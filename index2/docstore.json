Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies\nBackground\nCSX Corporation together with its subsidiaries (\"CSX\" or the “Company”), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nation's\nleading transportation companies. The Company provides rail-based transportation services including traditional rail service, the transport\nof intermodal containers and trailers, as well as other transportation services such as rail-to-truck transfers and bulk commodity operations.\n    CSX's principal operating subsidiary, CSX Transportation, Inc. (“CSXT”), provides an important link to the transportation supply chain\nthrough its approximately 19,500 route mile rail network, which serves major population centers in 23 states east of the Mississippi River,\nthe District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The Company's intermodal business links customers to\nrailroads via trucks and terminals.\nCSXT is also responsible for the Company's real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development activities.\nSubstantially all of these activities are focused on supporting railroad operations.\nOther entities\n    In addition to CSXT, the Company’s subsidiaries include Quality Carriers, Inc. (\"Quality Carriers\"), CSX Intermodal Terminals, Inc. (“CSX\nIntermodal Terminals”), Total Distribution Services, Inc. (“TDSI”), Transflo Terminal Services, Inc. (“Transflo”), CSX Technology, Inc. (“CSX\nTechnology”) and other subsidiaries. Effective July 1, 2021, CSX acquired Quality Carriers, the largest provider of bulk liquid chemicals\ntruck transportation in North America, from Quality Distribution, Inc. For further details, refer to Note 12, Business Combinations. CSX\nIntermodal Terminals owns and operates a system of intermodal terminals, predominantly in the eastern United States and also performs\ndrayage services (the pickup and delivery of intermodal shipments) for certain customers. TDSI serves the automotive industry with\ndistribution centers and storage locations. Transflo connects non-rail served customers to the many benefits of rail by transferring products\nfrom rail to trucks. The biggest Transflo markets are chemicals and agriculture, which includes shipments of plastics and ethanol. CSX\nTechnology and other subsidiaries provide support services for the Company.\nSale of Property Rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three CSX-owned line\nsegments to the Commonwealth of Virginia (“Commonwealth”) over three phases for a total of $525 million. The timing and amount of\ngains recognized are based on the allocation of fair value to each conveyance, the timing of future conveyances and collectability. In April\n2021, upon closing of the first phase of the agreement, the Company collected $200 million in proceeds and recognized a $349 million\ngain. In fourth quarter 2021, the Company collected additional proceeds of $200 million, a portion of which was attributable to the first\nphase with the remainder attributable to the second phase. The second phase closed on January 10, 2022, resulting in a $20 million gain\nin first quarter 2022.\nThe Company anticipates closing on the remaining conveyances by the end of 2022, which will result in future cash proceeds and\ngains. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying values of the remaining assets subject to this transaction were not material.\nCSX Q1 2022 Form 10-Q p.7","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/0d6aebf4-50e0-4ef4-b9d7-59dde7c1eb3d.pdf","pdf_numpages":48,"loc":{"lines":{"from":285,"to":320}}}}],["a34ce9c9-beeb-4a4f-bcb2-0c0232f7dc4b",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 1.    Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, continued\nBasis of Presentation\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all normal, recurring adjustments\nnecessary to fairly present the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Where applicable, prior year information has\nbeen reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”), certain information and disclosures normally included in the notes to the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) have been omitted from these interim financial statements. CSX suggests that\nthese financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes included in CSX's most recent annual\nreport on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed current reports on Form 8-K.\nCommon Stock Split\nOn June 4, 2021, CSX announced a three-for-one split of the Company’s common stock in the form of a stock dividend. Each\nshareholder of record on June 18, 2021, received two additional shares of common stock for each share held as of this record date. The\nnew shares were distributed after close of trading on June 28, 2021. All prior period share and per share amounts, common stock, other\ncapital, and retained earnings presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock split. Proportional\nadjustments were also made to outstanding awards under the Company's stock-based compensation plans.\nOther Capital\nAs a result of the stock split during second quarter 2021, CSX's common stock balance was increased and its other capital balance\nwas reduced commensurately. Because this adjustment brought the other capital balance below zero, $1.0 billion was reclassified from\nretained earnings to other capital to bring the other capital balance to zero as of June 30, 2021. Prior period amounts have also been\nretroactively adjusted as needed to bring the other capital balance to zero.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company's fiscal periods are based upon the calendar year. Except as otherwise specified, references to “first quarter(s)” or\n“three months” indicate CSX's fiscal periods ending March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, and references to \"year-end\" indicate the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2021.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn  March  2020,  the  Financial Accounting  Standards  Board  (\"FASB\")  issued Accounting  Standards  Update  (\"ASU\")  2020-04,\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. As the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") will no longer\nbe available beginning July 2023, this standard update provides practical expedients for contract modifications made as part of the\ntransition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates. CSX's revolving line of credit currently uses LIBOR as a reference rate. This standard\nupdate can be adopted prospectively through December 31, 2022. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of this standard update,\nbut does not anticipate that adoption will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Disclosure by Business Entities about Government Assistance. This standard\nupdate requires annual disclosure of the nature of any government assistance received, accounting policies related to such assistance and\nthe effect of that assistance on the entity’s financial statements. The Company is required to adopt this guidance effective year end 2022,\nthough early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on its disclosures, but this\nstandard update will not impact the Company's results of operations or financial position.\nCSX Q1 2022 Form 10-Q p.8","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/0d6aebf4-50e0-4ef4-b9d7-59dde7c1eb3d.pdf","pdf_numpages":48,"loc":{"lines":{"from":322,"to":362}}}}],["6fbe5869-0a16-4a2d-aced-05e0acc4f890",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 2.

Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt\nissuances. Shares are retired immediately upon repurchase.

Stock Plans and Share-Based Compensation, continued\nLong-term Incentive Plan\n    On February 16, 2022, the Company granted 494 thousand performance units to certain employees under a new long-term incentive\nplan (\"LTIP\") for the years 2022 through 2024, which was adopted under the CSX 2019 Stock and Incentive Award Plan.\n    Payouts of performance units for the cycle ending with fiscal year 2024 will be based on the achievement of goals related to both\noperating income growth and CSX Cash Earnings (\"CCE\"), in each case excluding non-recurring items as defined in the plan. The average\nannual operating income growth percentage and CCE measures over the plan period will each comprise 50% of the payout and will be\nmeasured independently of the other. As defined under the plan, CCE is a cash-flow based measure that incentivizes strategic investments\nearning more than the required return.

Should a number of these items occur in the same period, however, their combined effect could be material in that\nparticular period.\nCasualty\n     Casualty reserves of $181 million and $180 million as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, represent accruals for\npersonal injury, occupational disease and occupational injury claims primarily related to railroad operations. Beginning June 1, 2021, the\nCompany's  self-insured  retention  amount  for  these  claims  increased  from  $75  million  to  $100  million  per  occurrence.  Currently,  no\nindividual claim is expected to exceed the self-insured retention amount. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, to the\nextent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis\nwith a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes\nin estimate. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and\nuncertainties in litigation. Most of the Company's casualty claims relate to CSXT. Defense and processing costs, which historically have\nbeen insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities.\nPersonal Injury\n        Personal  injury  reserves  represent  liabilities  for  employee  work-related  and  third-party  injuries.  Work-related  injuries  for  CSXT\nemployees  are  primarily  subject  to  the  Federal  Employers’  Liability  Act  (“FELA”).  CSXT  retains  an  independent  actuary  to  assist\nmanagement in assessing the value of personal injury claims. An analysis is performed by the actuary quarterly and is reviewed by\nmanagement. This analysis did not result in a material adjustment to the personal injury reserve in the quarter ended March 31, 2022 or\nMarch 31, 2021.

Beginning  in  second  quarter  2020,  the  Company  retains  an  independent  actuary  to  analyze  the\nCompany’s historical claim filings, settlement amounts, and dismissal rates to assist in determining future anticipated claim filing rates and\naverage settlement values. This analysis is performed by the actuary and reviewed by management quarterly. Previously, the quarterly\nanalysis was performed by management.

The\nCompany is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving\nprivate  parties  and  regulatory  agencies.  The  Company  has  been  identified  as  a  potentially  responsible  party  at  approximately  220\nenvironmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental\nResponse, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\"), also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these\nproceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these\nproceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or\noperated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company's land holdings were leased to others for\ncommercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property\nand could give rise to proceedings against the Company.\nIn any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as\nwell as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and\noperators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial.\nIn accordance with the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with\nrespect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:\n•type of clean-up required;\n•nature of the Company's alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the\nsite);\n•extent of the Company's alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and\n•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.\nCSX Q1 2022 Form 10-Q p.15","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/0d6aebf4-50e0-4ef4-b9d7-59dde7c1eb3d.pdf","pdf_numpages":48,"loc":{"lines":{"from":570,"to":604}}}}],["a309c58a-20a0-4517-aa05-fdf497224701",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 4.

The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant\nongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries.

Environmental remediation costs are included in purchased services and other on the consolidated income\nstatements.\nCurrently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any,\non some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given\nlocation,  result  in  additional  exposure,  the  amount  and  materiality  of  which  cannot  presently  be  reasonably  estimated.

Also included in other reserves are\nlongshoremen disability claims related to a previously owned international shipping business (these claims are in runoff) as well as claims\nfor current port employees.\nNOTE 5.    Commitments and Contingencies\nInsurance\n    The Company maintains insurance programs with substantial limits for property damage, including resulting business interruption, and\nthird-party liability. A certain amount of risk is retained by the Company on each insurance program. Under its property insurance program,\nthe Company retains all risk up to $100 million per occurrence for losses from floods and named windstorms and up to $75 million per\noccurrence for other property losses. For third-party liability claims, the Company retains all risk up to $100 million per occurrence. As CSX\nnegotiates insurance coverage above its full self-retention amounts, it retains a percentage of risk at various layers of coverage. While the\nCompany believes its insurance coverage is adequate, future claims could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not\ncontinue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.\nCSX Q1 2022 Form 10-Q p.16","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/0d6aebf4-50e0-4ef4-b9d7-59dde7c1eb3d.pdf","pdf_numpages":48,"loc":{"lines":{"from":606,"to":636}}}}],["cab3bdbb-d885-410d-b47f-aa6f416501f4",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 5.    Commitments and Contingencies, continued\nLegal\n    The Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various\ngovernmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel surcharge practices, tax matters,\nenvironmental and hazardous material exposure matters, FELA and labor claims by current or former employees, other personal injury or\nproperty claims and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges. Some of the legal proceedings include\nclaims for compensatory as well as punitive damages and others are, or are purported to be, class actions. While the final outcome of\nthese matters cannot be predicted with certainty, considering, among other things, the legal defenses available and liabilities that have\nbeen recorded along with applicable insurance, it is currently the opinion of management that none of these pending items is likely to have\na material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. An unexpected adverse resolution of one\nor more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or\nliquidity in that particular period.\n    The Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss for certain legal proceedings for which a loss is reasonably possible in excess\nof reserves established. The Company has estimated this range to be $2 million to $22 million in aggregate at March 31, 2022. This\nestimated  aggregate  range  is  based  upon  currently  available  information  and  is  subject  to  significant  judgment  and  a  variety  of\nassumptions. Accordingly, the Company's estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current\nestimate.\nFuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation\n    In May 2007, class action lawsuits were filed against CSXT and three other U.S.-based Class I railroads alleging that the defendants'\nfuel surcharge practices relating to contract and unregulated traffic resulted from an illegal conspiracy in violation of antitrust laws. The\nclass action lawsuits were consolidated into one case in federal court in the District of Columbia. In 2017, the District Court issued its\ndecision denying class certification. On August 16, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the District Court’s ruling.\n    The consolidated case is now moving forward without class certification. Although a class was not certified, shippers other than those\nwho brought the original lawsuit in 2007 must decide whether to bring their own individual claim against one or more railroads. Individual\nshipper claims filed to date have been consolidated into a separate case.\n    CSXT believes that its fuel surcharge practices were arrived at and applied lawfully and that the case is without merit. Accordingly, the\nCompany intends to defend itself vigorously. However, penalties for violating antitrust laws can be severe, and resolution of these matters\nindividually or when aggregated could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity\nin that particular period.\nCSX Q1 2022 Form 10-Q p.17","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/0d6aebf4-50e0-4ef4-b9d7-59dde7c1eb3d.pdf","pdf_numpages":48,"loc":{"lines":{"from":638,"to":671}}}}],["074eace8-055d-43bf-ba4a-c79fbcf9b8db",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 5.    Commitments and Contingencies, continued\nEnvironmental\n    CSXT is indemnifying Pharmacia LLC, formerly known as Monsanto Company, (\"Pharmacia\") for certain liabilities associated with real\nestate  located  in  Kearny,  New  Jersey  along  the  Lower  Passaic  River  (the  “Property”). The  Property,  which  was  formerly  owned  by\nPharmacia,  is  now  owned  by  CSXT.  CSXT's  indemnification  and  defense  duties  arise  with  respect  to  several  matters.  The  U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), using its CERCLA authority, seeks the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances in the\n17-mile Lower Passaic River Study Area (the \"Study Area”). CSXT, on behalf of Pharmacia, and a significant number of other potentially\nresponsible parties are together conducting a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study of the Study Area pursuant to an Administrative\nSettlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA. Pharmacia’s share of responsibility, indemnified by CSXT, for the investigation\nand cleanup costs of the Study Area may be determined through various mechanisms including (a) an allocation and settlement with EPA;\n(b) litigation brought by EPA against non-settling parties; or (c) litigation among the responsible parties.\nFor the lower 8 miles of the Study Area, EPA issued its Record of Decision detailing the agency’s mandated remedial process in\nMarch 2016. Approximately 80 parties, including Pharmacia, are participating in an EPA-directed allocation and settlement process to\nassign responsibility for the remedy selected for the lower 8 miles of the Study Area. CSXT is participating in the EPA-directed allocation\nand settlement process on behalf of Pharmacia.\nFor the remainder of the Study Area, EPA has selected an interim remedy in a Record of Decision dated September 28, 2021.\nSettlement discussions are also ongoing for the selected interim remedy. On March 2, 2022, EPA issued a Notice Letter to Pharmacia,\nOccidental  Chemical  Corporation  and  eight  other  parties  alleging  they  are  liable  under  Section  107(a)  of  CERCLA  for  releases  or\nthreatened releases of hazardous substances and requesting each party, individually or collectively, submit good faith offers to EPA in\nconnection with the Study Area. The Notice Letter also offers the assistance of EPA’s Conflict Prevention and Resolution Center to facilitate\ndiscussions between the parties receiving the Notice Letter.\n    CSXT is also defending and indemnifying Pharmacia with regard to the Property in litigation filed by Occidental Chemical Corporation,\nwhich is seeking to recover various costs. These costs include costs for the remedial design of the lower 8 miles of the Study Area, as well\nas anticipated costs associated with the future remediation of the entire Study Area. Alternatively, Occidental seeks to compel some, or all\nof the defendants to participate in the remediation of the Study Area. Pharmacia is one of approximately 110 defendants in this federal\nlawsuit filed by Occidental on June 30, 2018.\n    CSXT is also defending and indemnifying Pharmacia in a cooperative natural resource damages assessment process related to the\nProperty. Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe any indemnification or remediation costs potentially\nallocable to CSXT with respect to the Property and the Study Area would be material to the Company's financial condition, results of\noperations or liquidity.\nCSX Q1 2022 Form 10-Q p.18","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/0d6aebf4-50e0-4ef4-b9d7-59dde7c1eb3d.pdf","pdf_numpages":48,"loc":{"lines":{"from":673,"to":707}}}}],["b3771506-6bdf-4fe3-bc0b-09b7ec4d6c9a",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 6.

Revenues, continued\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates revenue from rail freight billings under contracts with customers generally on a rate per carload, container\nor ton-basis based on length of haul and commodities carried. The Company’s performance obligation arises when it receives a bill of\nlading (“BOL”) to transport a customer's commodities at a negotiated price contained in a transportation services agreement or a publicly\ndisclosed  tariff  rate.  Once  a  BOL  is  received,  a  contract  is  formed  whereby  the  parties  are  committed  to  perform,  collectability  of\nconsideration is probable and the rights of the parties, shipping terms and conditions, and payment terms are identified. A customer may\nsubmit several BOLs for transportation services at various times throughout a service agreement term but each shipment represents a\ndistinct service that is a separately identified performance obligation.\nThe average transit time to complete a rail shipment is between 2 to 8 days depending on market. Payments for transportation\nservices are normally billed once a BOL is received and are generally due within 15 days after the invoice date. The Company recognizes\nrevenue over transit time of freight as it moves from origin to destination. Revenue for services started but not completed at the reporting\ndate is allocated based on the relative transit time in each reporting period, with the portion allocated for services subsequent to the\nreporting date considered remaining performance obligations.\nThe certain key estimates included in the recognition and measurement of revenue and related accounts receivable are as follows:\n•revenue associated with shipments in transit, which is recognized ratably over transit time and is based on average cycle times to\nmove commodities and products from their origin to their final destination or interchange;\n•adjustments to revenue for billing corrections and billing discounts;\n•adjustments to revenue for overcharge claims filed by customers, which are based on historical payments to customers for rate\novercharges as a percentage of total billing; and\n•incentive-based refunds to customers, which are primarily volume-related, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on the basis of\nthe projected liability (this estimate is based on historical activity, current volume levels and forecasted future volume).\nRevenue related to interline transportation services that involve the services of another party, such as another railroad, is reported\non a net basis. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to another party is not reflected as\nrevenue.\nEffective third quarter 2021, trucking revenue includes revenue from the operations of Quality Carriers. This revenue is mostly\ncomprised of truck shipments of chemicals and is recorded ratably over transit time.\nOther revenue is recorded upon completion of the service and is comprised of revenue from regional subsidiary railroads and\nincidental  charges,  including  intermodal  storage  and  equipment  usage,  demurrage  and  switching.  Revenue  from  regional  subsidiary\nrailroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Intermodal storage represents charges for customer\nstorage of containers at an intermodal terminal, ramp facility or offsite location beyond a specified period of time. Demurrage represents\ncharges assessed when freight cars are held by a customer beyond a specified period of time. Switching represents charges assessed\nwhen a railroad switches cars for a customer or another railroad.\nCSX Q1 2022 Form 10-Q p.22","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/0d6aebf4-50e0-4ef4-b9d7-59dde7c1eb3d.pdf","pdf_numpages":48,"loc":{"lines":{"from":842,"to":879}}}}],["40deaf5c-7b14-4f29-84ff-50984d209c76",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 8.

This includes the unearned portion of billed and unbilled amounts for cancellable freight shipments\nin transit.

Fair Value Measurements\nThe Financial Instruments Topic in the ASC requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in annual reports as well\nas in quarterly reports. For CSX, this statement applies to certain investments, long-term debt and interest rate derivatives. Disclosure of\nthe fair value of pension plan assets is only required annually. Also, this rule clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting,\nestablishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements.\nVarious inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company's investments, pension plan assets, long-term debt and\ninterest rate derivatives. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated\nwith investing in these securities. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.\n•Level 1 - observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;\n•Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.); and\n•Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Company's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants\nwould use in determining the fair value of investments).\nThe valuation methods described below may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or\nreflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other\nmarket participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could\nresult in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nInvestments\n    The Company's investment assets are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the Fair Value\nMeasurements and Disclosures Topic in the ASC. They are valued with assistance from a third-party trustee and consist of fixed income\nmutual funds, corporate bonds, government securities and commercial paper. The fixed income mutual funds are valued at the net asset\nvalue of shares held based on quoted market prices determined in an active market, which are Level 1 inputs. The corporate bonds and\ngovernment securities are valued using broker quotes that utilize observable market inputs, which are Level 2 inputs. The commercial\npaper is valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and is considered Level 2.\n    The Company's investment assets are summarized in the following table.\nMarch 31, 2022December 31, 2021\n(Dollars in Millions)\nLevel 1Level 2TotalLevel 1Level 2Total\nFixed Income Mutual Funds$87 $— $87 $75 $— $75 \nCorporate Bonds— 58 58 — 63 63 \nGovernment Securities— 23 23 — 26 26 \nCommercial Paper— 6 6 — — — \nTotal investments at fair value\n$87 $87 $174 $75 $89 $164 \nTotal investments at amortized cost$172 $156 \nCSX Q1 2022 Form 10-Q p.24","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/0d6aebf4-50e0-4ef4-b9d7-59dde7c1eb3d.pdf","pdf_numpages":48,"loc":{"lines":{"from":922,"to":960}}}}],["93e7bbdd-cb37-4fc3-9a44-9d93068a4c55",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 10.

The majority of the Company's long-term debt is valued with assistance from\na third party that utilizes closing transactions, market quotes or market values of comparable debt. For those instruments not valued by the\nthird party, the fair value has been estimated by applying market rates of similar instruments to the scheduled contractual debt payments\nand maturities. These market rates are provided by the same third party. All of the inputs used to determine the fair value of the Company's\nlong-term debt are Level 2 inputs.\nThe fair value of outstanding debt fluctuates with changes in a number of factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to,\ninterest rates, market conditions, credit ratings, values of similar financial instruments, size of the transaction, cash flow projections and\ncomparable trades. Fair value will exceed carrying value when the current market interest rate is lower than the interest rate at which the\ndebt was originally issued. The fair value of a company's debt is a measure of its current value under present market conditions. It does not\nimpact the financial statements under current accounting rules.

Total comprehensive earnings are defined as all changes in shareholders' equity during a period, other\nthan those resulting from investments by and distributions to shareholders (e.g. issuance of equity securities and dividends). Generally, for\nCSX, total comprehensive earnings equal net earnings plus or minus adjustments for pension and other post-retirement liabilities as well\nas derivative activity and other adjustments.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-GAAP Measures - Unaudited\n    CSX reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.\nGAAP). CSX also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G\nand Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior\nreported results.  Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s non-\nGAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP\nmeasures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance\nwith GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are below.\nFree Cash Flow\n    Management believes that free cash flow is supplemental information useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s\nfinancial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure\nrepresents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on\noutstanding debt. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and proceeds and\nadvances from property dispositions. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by\noperating activities. The increase in free cash flow before dividends from the prior year of $42 million is primarily due to an increase in cash\nfrom operating activities, partially offset by higher property additions.\n    The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow, before dividends (non-GAAP\nmeasure). \nThree Months\n(Dollars in millions)\n20222021\nNet cash provided by operating activities$1,299 $1,232 \nProperty Additions(331)(306)\nProceeds and Advances from Property Dispositions8 — \nOther Investing Activities \nn/a8 \nFree Cash Flow (before payment of dividends)\n$976 $934 \n(a) Effective first quarter 2022, the results of other investing activities are no longer included in free cash flow. Prior year has not been restated as the change is immaterial.\nOperating Statistics (Estimated)\nThe  Company  is  committed  to  continuous  improvement  in  safety  and  service  performance  through  training,  innovation  and\ninvestment.  Training  and  safety  programs  are  designed  to  prevent  incidents  that  can  adversely  impact  employees,  customers  and\ncommunities. Technological innovations that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents are designed to serve as an\nadditional  layer  of  protection  for  the  Company's  employees.  Continued  capital  investment  in  the  Company's  assets,  including  track,\nbridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.\nSafety metrics improved versus the first quarter 2021, with the number of both train accidents and personal injuries declining to\nnear record lows. The FRA train accident rate of 2.75 in first quarter 2022 improved 15% compared to prior year. The personal injury\nfrequency index of 0.78 improved 18% compared to prior year. Safety is a top priority at CSX, and the Company is committed to reducing\nrisk and enhancing the overall safety of its employees, customers and communities in which CSX operates.\n(a)\nCSX Q1 2022 Form 10-Q p.32","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/0d6aebf4-50e0-4ef4-b9d7-59dde7c1eb3d.pdf","pdf_numpages":48,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1214,"to":1257}}}}],["b273824b-d5b5-4fde-abf3-66ce2b8953e4",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2.

CSX uses\ncurrent cash balances for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, working capital requirements, reduction or\nrefinancing of outstanding indebtedness, redemptions and repurchases of CSX common stock, dividends to shareholders, acquisitions and\nother business opportunities, and contributions to the Company's qualified pension plan. See Note 7, Debt and Credit Agreements.\nThe Company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. The Company filed\na shelf registration statement with the SEC on February 16, 2022, which may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion,\nsubject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements,\nthere can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all.\nDuring the first quarter 2022, CSX did not issue any new long-term debt.\nCSX Q1 2022 Form 10-Q p.34","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/0d6aebf4-50e0-4ef4-b9d7-59dde7c1eb3d.pdf","pdf_numpages":48,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1314,"to":1341}}}}],["6aaf7977-cbc0-4404-b38a-3043fba29f27",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCSX has a $1.2 billion unsecured, revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in March 2024. At\nMarch 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding balances under this facility. The Company also has a commercial paper program,\nbacked  by  the  revolving  credit  facility,  under  which  the  Company  may  issue  unsecured  commercial  paper  notes  up  to  a  maximum\naggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any one time. At March 31, 2022, the Company had no outstanding debt under\nthe commercial paper program.\n    Planned capital investments for 2022 are expected to be approximately $2.0 billion. Of the 2022 investment, over 80% is expected to be\nused to sustain the core infrastructure and operating equipment. The remaining amounts will be used to promote profitable growth,\nincluding projects supporting service enhancements and productivity initiatives. CSX intends to fund capital investments through cash\ngenerated from operations.\nMaterial Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Working Capital\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n    Total assets decreased $79 million from year end primarily due to the $303 million decrease in cash described above which was partially\noffset by a $129 million increase in accounts receivable and a $44 million increase in investments in affiliates and other companies. The\nincrease in accounts receivable was driven by an increase in trade accounts receivable due to the timing of billing and cash receipts.\nTotal liabilities increased $226 million from year end primarily due to an increase in income and other taxes payable of $225 million\ndriven by the timing of estimated income tax payments. Total shareholders' equity decreased $305 million from year end primarily driven by\nshare repurchases of $1.0 billion and dividends paid of $219 million, partially offset by net earnings of $859 million.\nWorking capital is considered a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of\n$1.2 billion as of March 31, 2022 and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $458 million since year end. The decrease in\ncurrent assets was primarily due to the decrease in cash of $303 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $129\nmillion as described above. The increase in current liabilities was primarily the result of a $225 million increase in income and other taxes\npayable and a $136 million increase in current maturities of long term debt. The Company's working capital balance varies due to factors\nsuch as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. The Company\ncontinues to maintain adequate liquidity to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. CSX has sufficient\nfinancial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and shelf registration statement to manage its day-to-day\ncash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time to time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.\nCSX is committed to returning cash to shareholders and maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. Capital structure, capital\ninvestments and cash distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, are reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors.\nManagement's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and volume of repurchases.

Pan Am\nowns and operates a highly integrated, nearly 1,200-mile rail network and has a joint interest in the more than 600-mile Pan Am Southern\nsystem. This acquisition will expand CSX’s reach in the Northeastern United States. Assets and facilities to be acquired as part of the\nproposed  transaction  include  road  and  track  assets,  work  equipment,  land,  buildings  and  other  assets.  On  February  25,  2021,  the\nCompany began the process of seeking approval from the STB. The STB approved the acquisition on April 14, 2022, and closing is\nanticipated on June 1, 2022. This acquisition is not expected to be material with respect to the Company's financial statements when\nreviewed under the quantitative and qualitative considerations of Regulation S-X Article 11 and ASC Topic 805.\nSale of Property Rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three CSX-owned line\nsegments to the Commonwealth of Virginia (“Commonwealth”) over three phases for a total of $525 million. The timing and amount of\ngains recognized are based on the allocation of fair value to each conveyance, the timing of future conveyances and collectability. In April\n2021, upon closing of the first phase of the agreement, the Company collected $200 million in proceeds and recognized a $349 million\ngain. In fourth quarter 2021, the Company collected additional proceeds of $200 million, a portion of which was attributable to the first\nphase with the remainder attributable to the second phase. The second phase closed on January 10, 2022, resulting in a $20 million gain\nin first quarter 2022.\nThe Company anticipates closing on the remaining conveyances by the end of 2022, which will result in future cash proceeds and\ngains.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThere  have  been  no  material  changes  in  market  risk  from  the  information  provided  under  Part  II,  Item  7A  (Quantitative  and\nQualitative Disclosures about Market Risk) of CSX's most recent annual report on Form 10-K except as provided below.\nChanges in interest rates may impact the cost of future interest payments on long-term debt issued by the Company, and as a\nresult, represent interest rate risk to the Company. In an effort to manage this risk, CSX may use certain financial instruments such as\nfixed-to-floating interest rate swaps. The following information, together with information included in Note 7, Debt and Credit Agreements,\ndescribes the key aspects of such contracts and the related market risk to CSX.\nIn first quarter 2022, CSX entered into five separate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps classified as fair value hedges. The swaps\nare designed to hedge 10 years of interest rate risk associated with market fluctuations attributable to the Secured Overnight Financing\nRate on a cumulative $800 million of fixed rate outstanding notes which are due between 2036 and 2040. As of March 31, 2022, the fair\nvalue of these swaps was a $27 million liability, which is included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The\nassociated cumulative adjustment to the hedged notes is included in long-term debt. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value\nof the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt so no gain or loss has been\nrecognized due to hedge ineffectiveness. Differences on the fixed-to-floating legs of the derivatives are recognized in interest expense and\nwere not material in first quarter 2022. The swaps will expire in 2032. If settled early, the remaining liability or asset will be amortized over\nthe remaining life of the associated notes.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nAs of March 31, 2022, under the supervision and with the participation of CSX's Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial\nOfficer (“CFO”), management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and\nprocedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that, as of March 31, 2022, the Company's disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in CSX's\nperiodic SEC reports. There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2022\nthat have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nCSX Q1 2022 Form 10-Q p.41","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/0d6aebf4-50e0-4ef4-b9d7-59dde7c1eb3d.pdf","pdf_numpages":48,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1522,"to":1548}}}}],["2f489cb8-3bc8-462d-9150-c5b8f14cadc5",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

The Company’s merchandise business is comprised of shipments in the following diverse markets:\nchemicals, agricultural and food products, minerals, automotive, forest products, metals and equipment, and fertilizers.\n•The intermodal business shipped 3.0 million units (48% of volume) and generated $2.3 billion in revenue (16% of\nrevenue) in 2022. The intermodal business combines the superior economics of rail transportation with the flexibility of\ntrucks and offers a cost and environmental advantage over long-haul trucking. Through a network of approximately 30\nterminals,  the  intermodal  business  serves  all  major  markets  east  of  the  Mississippi  River  and  transports  mainly\nmanufactured consumer goods in containers, providing customers with truck-like service for longer shipments.\n•The coal business shipped 697 thousand carloads (11% of volume) and generated $2.4 billion in revenue (16% of\nrevenue) in 2022. The Company transports domestic coal, coke and iron ore to electricity-generating power plants, steel\nmanufacturers and industrial plants as well as export coal to deep-water port facilities. Most of the export coal the\nCompany  transports  is  used  for  steelmaking,  while  the  majority  of  domestic  coal  the  Company  ships  is  used  for\nelectricity generation.\n•The trucking business generated $966 million, or 7%, of revenue in 2022. Trucking revenue includes revenue from the\noperations of Quality Carriers, which was acquired by CSX effective July 1, 2021.\nOther revenue accounted for 6% of the Company’s total revenue in 2022. This category includes revenue from regional\nsubsidiary railroads and incidental charges, including intermodal storage and equipment usage, demurrage and switching. Revenue\nfrom regional subsidiary railroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Intermodal storage\nrepresents charges for customer storage of containers at an intermodal terminal, ramp facility or offsite location beyond a specified\nperiod of time. Demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held by a customer beyond a specified period of\ntime. Switching represents charges assessed when a railroad switches cars for a customer or another railroad.\nCSX's Committed Workforce\nMost  of  the  Company’s  employees  provide  or  support  transportation  services.  The  Company  had  more  than  22,500\nemployees as of December 2022, which includes approximately 17,100 employees that are members of a rail labor union. As of\nDecember 2, 2022, all 12 rail unions at CSX that participated in national bargaining were covered by national agreements with the\nClass I railroads and CSX-specific agreements that will remain in effect through December 31, 2024.

The CSX Code of Ethics serves as a guiding standard for ethical behavior and covers many\ntypes of matters, including discrimination and harassment as well as safety. Annually, all management employees are required, and\nunion employees are highly encouraged, to complete ethics training.\nCompany History\nA leader in freight rail transportation for nearly 200 years, the Company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth century\nwhen The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (“B&O”), the nation’s first common carrier, was chartered in 1827. Since that time,\nthe Company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the ever-increasing demands of\na growing nation. Since its founding, numerous railroads have combined with the former B&O through merger and consolidation to\ncreate what has become CSX. Each of the railroads that combined into the CSX family brought new geographical reach to valuable\nmarkets, gateways, cities, ports and transportation corridors.\nCSX Corporation was incorporated in 1978 under Virginia law. In 1980, the Company completed the merger of the Chessie\nSystem and Seaboard Coast Line Industries into CSX. The merger allowed the Company to connect northern population centers\nand Appalachian coal fields to growing southeastern markets. Later, the Company’s acquisition of key portions of Conrail, Inc.\n(\"Conrail\") allowed CSXT to link the northeast, including New England and the New York metropolitan area, with Chicago and\nmidwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the Southeast already served by CSXT. This current rail network, which now\nincludes the network acquired from Pan Am, allows the Company to directly serve every major market in the eastern United States\nwith safe, dependable, environmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service.\nCompetition\nThe business environment in which the Company operates is highly competitive. Shippers typically select transportation\nproviders that offer the most compelling combination of service and price. Service requirements, both in terms of transit time and\nreliability, vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company’s primary competition varies by commodity, geographic location\nand mode of available transportation and includes other railroads, motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area\nand, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines.\nCSXT’s primary rail competitor is Norfolk Southern Railway, which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory.\nOther  railroads  also  operate  in  parts  of  the  Company’s  territory.  Depending  on  the  specific  market,  competing  railroads  and\nderegulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels.

Noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations\ncould erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or regulatory\nsanctions.\nCSXT, as a common carrier by rail, is required by law to transport hazardous materials, which could expose the Company\nto significant costs and claims.\nA train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal injury,\nproperty or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could exceed\nexisting  insurance  coverage  or  insurance  may  not  continue  to  be  available  at  commercially  reasonable  rates.  Under  federal\nregulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier mandate.\nCSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the\nTSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail transit\nsystems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to significant\npenalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident.

Changes in natural gas\nprices, or other factors impacting demand for electricity, could impact future power generation at coal-fired plants, which would\naffect the Company's domestic coal volumes and revenues.\nWeaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.\nThe Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments, commercial paper and\nbank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of the\nCompany’s financial condition due to internal or external factors, could restrict or prohibit access and could increase financing\ncosts. A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or affect its\naccess to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.\nAvailability of Critical Supplies and Labor\nThe unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet\ndemand.\nMarketplace conditions for resources like locomotives as well as the availability of qualified personnel, particularly engineers\nand conductors, could each have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to meet demand for rail service. Although the\nCompany strives to maintain adequate resources and personnel for the current business environment, unpredictable increases in\ndemand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on the\nCompany’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of\noperations, or liquidity in a particular period.\nDisruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.\nThe capital intensive and unique nature of core rail equipment (including rail, ties, freight cars and locomotives) limits the\nnumber of railroad equipment suppliers. If any of the current manufacturers stops production or experiences a supply shortage,\nCSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical railroad suppliers are foreign and,\nas such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in international shipping or increases in\nglobal demand could make procurement of these supplies more difficult or increase CSXT's costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply\nshortage were to arise, the Company would be negatively impacted.\nFailure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages.\nMost of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These\nagreements are either bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee or locally between CSX and the\nunion. Such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work\nstoppages.  Under  the  Railway  Labor Act's  procedures  (which  include  mediation,  cooling-off  periods  and  the  possibility  of  an\nintervention by the President of the United States), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are\nexhausted. If, however, CSX is unable to negotiate acceptable agreements, the employees covered by the Railway Labor Act could\nstrike, which could result in loss of business and increased operating costs as a result of higher wages or benefits paid to union\nmembers. \nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.11","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/154a3c81-ff7c-4cec-a7f2-fd79a60308f9.pdf","pdf_numpages":130,"loc":{"lines":{"from":419,"to":457}}}}],["3348db48-bd0f-4f07-932b-7878a53f77f4",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART I\nClimate Change and Environmental\nThe Company’s operations and financial results could be negatively impacted by climate change and regulatory and\nlegislative responses to climate change.\nThere is potential for operational impacts from changing weather patterns or rising sea levels in the Company's operational\nterritory, which could impact the Company's network or other assets.\nClimate change and other emissions-related laws and regulations have been proposed and, in some cases adopted, on the\nfederal, state, provincial and local levels.

In particular, the EPA has issued various regulations and may issue additional regulations targeting\nemissions, including rules and standards governing emissions from certain stationary sources and from vehicles. Any of these\npending or proposed laws or regulations, including any proposed or implemented under the Biden administration, could adversely\naffect the Company's operations and financial results by, among other things: (i) reducing coal-fired electricity generation due to\nmandated emission standards; (ii) reducing the consumption of coal as a viable energy resource in the United States and Canada;\n(iii) increasing the Company's fuel, capital and other operating costs and negatively affecting operating and fuel efficiencies; and (iv)\nmaking it difficult for the Company's customers in the U.S. and Canada to produce products in a cost competitive manner.

This route, also known as the “waterlevel route,” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks\n(referred to as double track). These engineering attributes permit the corridor to support high-speed service across intermodal,\nautomotive and merchandise commodities. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through\nwestern ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90\nCorridor  is  also  a  critical  link  between  ports  in  New  York,  New  Jersey,  and  Pennsylvania  and  consumption  markets  in  the\nMidwest. This route carries goods from all three of the Company’s major rail markets – merchandise, intermodal and coal.\nInterstate 95 (I-95) Corridor – The CSXT I-95 Corridor connects Charleston, Jacksonville, Miami and many other cities throughout\nthe Southeast with the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York. CSXT\nprimarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the leading rail corridor along\nthe eastern seaboard south of the District of Columbia and provides access to major eastern ports.\nSoutheastern  Corridor  – This  critical  part  of  the  network  runs  between  CSXT’s  western  gateways  of  Chicago,  St.  Louis  and\nMemphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is the\npremier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected traffic\nvolumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between the coal\nreserves of the southern Illinois basin and the demand for coal in the Southeast.\nCoal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region and Illinois basin\nwith industrial areas in the Southeast, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port facilities. The\ndomestic coal market has declined significantly over the last decade and export coal remains subject to a high degree of volatility.\nCSXT’s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast and to transport coal\nshipments for export outside of the U.S. Most of the export coal the Company transports is used for steelmaking, while the majority\nof domestic coal the Company ships is used for electricity generation.\nSee the following page for a map of the CSX Rail Network.

Descriptions of each expense category as\nwell as significant year-over-year changes are described below.\n \nLabor and Fringe expenses include employee wages and related payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension, other post-\nretirement benefits and incentive compensation. These expenses increased $311 million due to the following items:\n•The impacts of agreements reached with labor unions as well as inflation totaled $199 million. Of the total, $32\nmillion relates to labor and benefits in prior years.\n•The inclusion of Quality Carriers' operations for the full year in 2022 versus a portion of the year in 2021 resulted in\nincreased costs of $74 million.\n•Incentive compensation costs decreased $29 million primarily due to the impact of accelerated expense for eligible\nemployees in the prior year.\n•Other costs increased $67 million primarily due to hiring and retention costs, the inclusion of Pan Am's operations\nand other non-significant items.\nPurchased Services and Other expenses consist primarily of contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment, terminal\nand pier services, purchased trucking and other transportation, and professional services. This category also includes costs related\nto materials, travel, casualty claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, property and sales tax, utilities and other items.\nTotal purchased services and other expenses increased $550 million driven by the following:\n•The inclusion of Quality Carriers' operations for the full year in 2022 versus a portion of the year in 2021 drove $280\nmillion of additional costs.\n•Higher operating support costs, primarily due to inflation, higher intermodal terminal costs and an increased active\nlocomotive fleet, drove an increase of $182 million.\n•Adjustments to environmental reserves resulted in $21 million higher expense.\n•All other costs increased $67 million primarily due to several non-significant items including Pan Am's operations and\nacquisition-related costs.\nFuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price and\nlocomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $713 million primarily due to a 66% price increase in locomotive fuel\nprices and the inclusion of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking.\nDepreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the costs of capital assets, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure,\nover their respective useful lives, which are reviewed periodically as part of depreciation studies. This expense is impacted primarily\nby the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $80 million primarily due to a larger net asset base,\nwhich includes Quality Carriers' assets, as well as the impacts of a 2022 equipment depreciation study.\nEquipment and Other Rents expense includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents\nreceived by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term leases\nof locomotives, railcars, containers, tractors and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses increased $32 million primarily\ndue to increased car hire costs as well as the addition of Quality Carriers' costs. Car hire costs increased due to higher days per\nload and inflation, partially offset by lower volume.\nGains on Property Dispositions decreased to $238 million in 2022 from $454 million in 2021 primarily due to lower gains from the\nsale of property rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia. Related to this transaction, CSX recognized gains of $144 million in 2022\nand $349 million in 2021.\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.27","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/154a3c81-ff7c-4cec-a7f2-fd79a60308f9.pdf","pdf_numpages":130,"loc":{"lines":{"from":976,"to":1018}}}}],["83686f19-4596-4a8c-aaf9-ee4d5ce513d1",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nInterest Expense\nInterest Expense includes interest on long-term debt, equipment obligations and finance leases.

Other income increased $54 million primarily due to higher interest\nincome, driven by increased rates, and an increase in net pension benefit credits during 2022.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome Tax Expense increased $78 million primarily due to higher earnings before income taxes, partially offset by favorable\nadjustments to deferred state taxes and favorable state legislative changes.\nNet Earnings and Earnings per Diluted Share\nNet Earnings increased $385 million to $4.2 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.27 to $1.95, due to the factors\nmentioned above.

CSX\nalso uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and\nRegulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior\nreported results. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s non-\nGAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-\nGAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented\nin accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are below.\nFree Cash Flow\nManagement believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s financial\nperformance.  More  specifically,  free  cash  flow  measures  cash  generated  by  the  business  after  reinvestment.  This  measure\nrepresents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on\noutstanding debt. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and proceeds\nfrom  property  dispositions. This  measure  should  be  considered  in  addition  to,  rather  than  a  substitute  for,  cash  provided  by\noperating activities. Free cash flow before dividends decreased $101 million year-over-year to $3.7 billion primarily due to higher\nproperty additions and lower proceeds and advances from property dispositions, mostly attributable to the sale of property rights to\nthe Commonwealth of Virginia. These decreases were partially offset by higher net cash provided by operating activities.\nThe  following  table  reconciles  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  (GAAP  measure)  to  free  cash  flow  (non-GAAP\nmeasure).\n \nYears Ended\n 20222021\n(Dollars in Millions)\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities$5,619 $5,099 \nProperty Additions(2,133)(1,791)\nProceeds and Advances from Property Dispositions246 529 \nOther Investing Activities \nn/a(4)\nFree Cash Flow, before Dividends (Non-GAAP)\n$3,732 $3,833 \n(a) Effective first quarter 2022, the results of other investing activities are no longer included in free cash flow.

Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would\ncost  the  Company  to  buy  enough  high  quality  bonds  to  generate  cash  flow  equal  to  the  Company's  expected  future  benefit\npayments.

Under the spot rate approach, individual spot discount rates\nalong the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension benefit liabilities are applied to the relevant\nprojected cash flows at the relevant maturity.\nThe weighted average discount rate used by the Company to value its pension obligations was 5.02% and 2.78% as of\nDecember  2022,  and  December  2021,  respectively.  As  of  December  2022,  the  estimated  duration  of  pension  benefits  is\napproximately 10 years.\nEach year, the discount rate is reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate\nbonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the assumed\ndiscount rate will change.\nLong-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets\nThe expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds\ninvested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company\ngives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be\navailable for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management, with the assistance of an\noutsourced investment manager, balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers with both market and\nactual  plan  historical  returns  to  develop  a  reasonable  estimate  of  the  expected  long-term  rate  of  return  on  assets.

If the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or\nintangible assets are less than their carrying amounts, the Company would perform a quantitative impairment test. If the carrying\namount of the reporting unit's goodwill or intangible asset exceeded the fair value under the quantitative test, an impairment loss\nwould be recorded. Measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit could be based on one or more of the following fair value\nmeasures: amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, present\nvalue techniques of estimated future cash flows, valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue, or a similar\nperformance measure.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy\n    See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption “New Accounting Pronouncements and\nChanges in Accounting Policy.”\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.41","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/154a3c81-ff7c-4cec-a7f2-fd79a60308f9.pdf","pdf_numpages":130,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1468,"to":1504}}}}],["c9cf4ffd-508e-44b6-bb05-b88d888ca5fb",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n        Certain  statements  in  this  report  and  in  other  materials  filed  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  as  well  as\ninformation included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company, are forward-looking statements.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n \nChanges in interest rates may impact the cost of future long-term debt issued by the Company, and as a result, represent\ninterest rate risk to the Company. In an effort to manage this risk, CSX may use certain financial instruments such as interest rate\nforward contracts. The following information, together with information included in Note 10, Debt and Credit Agreements, describes\nthe key aspects of such contracts and the related market risk to CSX.\nChanges in interest rates could impact the fair value of the Company's forward starting interest rate swap. In 2020, the\nCompany executed two forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of $250 million for an aggregate notional value of\n$500 million. These swaps were effected to hedge the benchmark interest rate associated with future interest payments related to\nthe anticipated refinancing of notes due in 2027. The Company recognized an unrealized gain of $80 million and $8 million net of\ntax during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income\nwith the related asset on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. In fourth quarter 2022, CSX settled a portion equal to $160\nmillion notional value of the aggregate $500 million cash flow hedges, which resulted in CSX receiving a cash payment of $52\nmillion. The gain associated with the settled portion of the hedges will continue to be classified in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (“AOCI”) until the associated debt instrument is issued in the future. Upon final settlement of the swaps, which expire in\n2027, the unrealized gain or loss in AOCI will be recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period\nduring which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of December 31, 2022, the potential change in fair value resulting from a\nhypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be material.\nChanges in interest rates could impact the fair value of the Company's fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps. In 2022, CSX\nentered into five separate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps classified as fair value hedges. The swaps are designed to hedge 10\nyears of interest rate risk associated with market fluctuations attributable to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate on a cumulative\n$800 million of fixed rate outstanding notes, which are due between 2036 and 2040. As of December 31, 2022, the cumulative fair\nvalue of these swaps was a $118 million liability, which is included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe associated cumulative adjustment to the hedged notes is included in long-term debt. Gains and losses resulting from changes\nin fair value of the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt with no gain or\nloss recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness. The difference in the net fixed-to-float interest settlement on the derivatives is\nrecognized in interest expense and was not material for the year ending at December 31, 2022. The swaps will expire in 2032. If\nsettled early, the remaining liability or asset will be amortized over the remaining life of the associated notes. As of December 31,\n2022, the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be material.\nAs of December 31, 2022, CSX has no floating rate notes outstanding. However, changes in interest rates could impact the\nfair value (but not the carrying value) of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt. The potential decrease in fair value of the\nCompany's fixed rate long-term debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in U.S. Treasury rates, or approximately 40 basis\npoints, is estimated to be $709 million as of December 31, 2022, and $448 million as of December 31, 2021.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required\nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nfinancial statements.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, continued\nDepreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life Method\nDescription of the\nMatter\nAs of December 31, 2022, assets depreciated under the group-life method comprised 84% of total gross fixed\nassets of $48.1 billion. As discussed in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements, the group-life method\naggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a\nwhole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is\nused and depreciated to the end of the group’s recoverable life. The Company utilizes different depreciable\nasset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the\ngroup-life method.\nUnder the group-life method, depreciation studies are conducted by a third-party specialist and analyzed by the\nCompany’s management to review asset service lives, salvage values, accumulated depreciation and other\nfactors related to group assets. Depreciation studies are performed every three years for equipment assets and\nevery six years for road and track assets. In years when depreciation studies are not performed, annual data\nreviews are conducted by a third-party specialist and analyzed by the Company’s management to review the\nasset service lives. A depreciation study was performed in 2022 for equipment assets. For road and track\nassets,  the  most  recent  depreciation  study  was  performed  in  2020  and  was  evaluated  in  the  current  year\nthrough an annual data review.\nAuditing  depreciation  expense  for  assets  subject  to  the  group-life  method  was  complex  and  required  the\ninvolvement of specialists due to the nature of the methods used in the depreciation studies to determine the\nuseful service lives and salvage values of the Company’s assets. These methods have a significant effect on\ndepreciation expense.\nHow We\nAddressed the\nMatter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the\nCompany’s process related to the assessment of periodic depreciation studies and annual data reviews of its\ngroup-life assets. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the depreciation study for\nequipment assets and review of depreciation expense and estimated useful lives. We also tested controls over\nmanagement’s annual data review of asset activity and assumptions that could impact the estimated useful lives\ndetermined in the most recent depreciation study of road and track assets.\nTo test the estimated useful lives and salvage values of the Company’s group-life assets, we performed audit\nprocedures that included, among others: obtaining the periodic depreciation studies and annual data reviews\nperformed by the Company’s third-party specialist and reviewed by management; assessing the completeness\nand accuracy of the data provided by management to the third-party specialist; and including a specialist on our\nteam to evaluate the methods used by the third-party specialist and reviewed by management in determining the\nestimated useful lives and salvage values of assets resulting from the depreciation studies and any changes to\nthe estimated useful lives and salvage values, if any, resulting from the annual data reviews.\n \nWe  compared  the  methods  used  by  management  to  those  used  throughout  the  industry  and  within  other\ndepreciation studies. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates via retrospective review\nand independently calculated the current year depreciation rates.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1981.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nJacksonville, Florida\nFebruary 15, 2023\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.47","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/154a3c81-ff7c-4cec-a7f2-fd79a60308f9.pdf","pdf_numpages":130,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1703,"to":1753}}}}],["3e027045-5346-4e84-a1ba-07ecfecca7eb",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nItem 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1.  Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies\nBusiness\nCSX Corporation together with its subsidiaries (\"CSX\" or the “Company”), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the\nnation's  leading  transportation  companies.  The  Company  provides  rail-based  transportation  services  including  traditional  rail\nservice, the transport of intermodal containers and trailers, as well as other transportation services such as rail-to-truck transfers\nand bulk commodity operations.\nCSX Transportation, Inc.\nCSX’s principal operating subsidiary, CSX Transportation, Inc. (“CSXT”), provides an important link to the transportation\nsupply chain through its approximately 20,000 route mile rail network and serves major population centers in 26 states east of the\nMississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. It has access to over 70 ocean, river\nand  lake  port  terminals  along  the  Atlantic  and  Gulf  Coasts,  the  Mississippi  River,  the  Great  Lakes  and  the  St.  Lawrence\nSeaway. The Company’s intermodal business links customers to railroads via trucks and terminals. CSXT also serves thousands of\nproduction and distribution facilities through track connections to more than 240 short-line and regional railroads. On June 1, 2022,\nCSX completed its acquisition of Pan Am Systems, Inc. (“Pan Am”), which is the parent company of Pan Am Railways, Inc. This\nacquisition expands CSXT’s reach in the Northeastern United States. For further details, refer to Note 17, Business Combinations.\nCSXT is also responsible for the Company's real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development\nactivities. Substantially all of these activities are focused on supporting railroad operations.\nOther Entities\nIn  addition  to  CSXT,  the  Company’s  subsidiaries  include  Quality  Carriers,  Inc.  (\"Quality  Carriers\"),  CSX  Intermodal\nTerminals, Inc. (“CSX Intermodal Terminals”), Total Distribution Services, Inc. (“TDSI”), Transflo Terminal Services, Inc. (“Transflo”),\nCSX Technology, Inc. (“CSX Technology”) and other subsidiaries. Effective July 1, 2021, CSX acquired Quality Carriers, the largest\nprovider  of  bulk  liquid  chemicals  truck  transportation  in  North  America.  For  further  details,  refer  to  Note  17, Business\nCombinations. CSX Intermodal Terminals owns and operates a system of intermodal terminals, predominantly in the eastern United\nStates, and also provides drayage services (the pickup and delivery of intermodal shipments) for certain customers. TDSI serves\nthe automotive industry with distribution centers and storage locations. Transflo connects non-rail served customers to the many\nbenefits of rail by transferring products from rail to trucks. The biggest Transflo markets are chemicals and agriculture, which\ninclude shipments of plastics and ethanol. CSX Technology and other subsidiaries provide support services for the Company.\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.53","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/154a3c81-ff7c-4cec-a7f2-fd79a60308f9.pdf","pdf_numpages":130,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1984,"to":2015}}}}],["b60ad3e2-23b8-4cd4-9291-c0664b8cd08c",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nNOTE 1.  Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, continued\nLines of Business\nDuring  2022,  the  Company's  services  generated  $14.9  billion  of  revenue  and  served  four  primary  lines  of  business:\nmerchandise, intermodal, coal and trucking.\n•The merchandise business shipped 2.6 million carloads (41% of volume) and generated $8.2 billion in revenue (55% of\nrevenue) in 2022. The Company’s merchandise business is comprised of shipments in the following diverse markets:\nchemicals, agricultural and food products, minerals, automotive, forest products, metals and equipment, and fertilizers.\n•The intermodal business shipped 3.0 million units (48% of volume) and generated $2.3 billion in revenue (16% of\nrevenue) in 2022. The intermodal business combines the superior economics of rail transportation with the flexibility of\ntrucks and offers a cost and environmental advantage over long-haul trucking. Through a network of approximately 30\nterminals,  the  intermodal  business  serves  all  major  markets  east  of  the  Mississippi  River  and  transports  mainly\nmanufactured consumer goods in containers, providing customers with truck-like service for longer shipments.\n•The coal business shipped 697 thousand carloads (11% of volume) and generated $2.4 billion in revenue (16% of\nrevenue) in 2022. The Company transports domestic coal, coke and iron ore to electricity-generating power plants, steel\nmanufacturers and industrial plants as well as export coal to deep-water port facilities. Most of the export coal the\nCompany  transports  is  used  for  steelmaking,  while  the  majority  of  domestic  coal  the  Company  ships  is  used  for\nelectricity generation.\n•The trucking business generated $966 million, or 7%, of revenue in 2022. Trucking revenue includes revenue from the\noperations of Quality Carriers, which was acquired by CSX effective July 1, 2021.\nOther revenue accounted for 6% of the Company’s total revenue in 2022. This category includes revenue from regional\nsubsidiary railroads and incidental charges, including intermodal storage and equipment usage, demurrage and switching. Revenue\nfrom regional subsidiary railroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Intermodal storage\nrepresents charges for customer storage of containers at an intermodal terminal, ramp facility or offsite location beyond a specified\nperiod of time. Demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held by a customer beyond a specified period of\ntime. Switching represents charges assessed when a railroad switches cars for a customer or another railroad.\nThe Company has two operating segments: rail and trucking. Although the Company provides a breakdown of revenue by\nline of business, the overall financial and operational performance of the railroad is analyzed as one operating segment due to the\nintegrated nature of the rail network. As the trucking segment is not material for separate disclosure, the results of all operations are\nincluded in one reportable segment.\nEmployees\nThe Company's number of employees was more than 22,500 as of December 2022, which includes approximately 17,100\nunion employees. Most of the Company’s employees provide or support transportation services.\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.54","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/154a3c81-ff7c-4cec-a7f2-fd79a60308f9.pdf","pdf_numpages":130,"loc":{"lines":{"from":2017,"to":2052}}}}],["4465bf85-14cb-4dc0-994d-dd7d08da00ee",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nItem 8.

Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, continued\nBasis of Presentation\nIn  the  opinion  of  management,  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  contain  all  normal,  recurring\nadjustments necessary to fairly present the financial position of CSX and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2022 and December 31,\n2021, and the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in shareholders’ equity for the\nyears  ended  2022,  2021  and  2020.  Where  applicable,  prior  year  information  has  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  current\npresentation. In addition, management has evaluated and disclosed all material events occurring subsequent to the date of the\nfinancial statements up to the date this annual report is filed on Form 10-K.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nrequires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of certain revenues and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Critical accounting estimates using management judgment are\nmade for the following areas:\n•personal injury and environmental reserves (see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves);\n•pension plan accounting (see Note 9, Employee Benefit Plans);\n•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method (see Note 6, Properties); and\n•goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets  (see  Note  17, Business  Combinations  and  Note  18, Goodwill  and  Other\nIntangibles).\nFiscal Year\nThe Company's fiscal periods are based upon the calendar year. Except as otherwise specified, references to full years\nindicate CSX’s fiscal years ended on December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\n    \nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include results of operations of CSX and subsidiaries over which CSX has majority\nownership or financial control. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Most investments in\ncompanies  that  were  not  majority-owned  were  carried  at  cost  (if  less  than  20%  owned  and  the  Company  has  no  significant\ninfluence) or were accounted for under the equity method (if the Company has significant influence but does not have control).\nThese investments are reported within Investment in Affiliates and Other Companies on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.55","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/154a3c81-ff7c-4cec-a7f2-fd79a60308f9.pdf","pdf_numpages":130,"loc":{"lines":{"from":2054,"to":2086}}}}],["76d486ce-7381-4fa9-92c6-d678ba9e1e4d",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nItem 8.

Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, continued\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nOn a daily basis, cash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in various highly liquid investments having a\ntypical maturity date of three months or less at the date of acquisition. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates\nmarket value, and are classified as cash equivalents.\nInvestments\nInvestments in instruments with original maturities greater than three months that will mature in less than one year are\nclassified as short-term investments. Investments with original maturities of one year or greater are initially classified within other\nlong-term assets, and the classification is re-evaluated at each balance sheet date.\nMaterials and Supplies\nMaterials and supplies in the consolidated balance sheets are carried at average cost and consist primarily of parts used in\nthe repair and maintenance of track structure, equipment, and CSXT’s freight car and locomotive fleets, as well as fuel.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2020-04,\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. As the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") will\nno longer be available beginning July 2023, this standard update provides practical expedients for contract modifications made as\npart of the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and practical expedients\ncan generally be applied through the extended period ending December 31, 2024. CSX's revolving line of credit currently uses\nLIBOR as a reference rate. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has not applied the practical expedient to any contracts.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Disclosure by Business Entities about Government Assistance. This\nstandard update requires annual disclosure of the nature of any government assistance received, accounting policies related to\nsuch assistance and the effect of that assistance on the entity’s financial statements. The Company adopted this guidance effective\nyear end 2022 and the standard update did not impact the Company's results of operations or financial position as the update only\nimpacts disclosures.

Earnings per\nshare, assuming dilution, is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and common stock\nequivalents adjusted for the effects of common stock that may be issued as a result of potentially dilutive instruments. CSX's\npotentially dilutive instruments are made up of equity awards including performance units and employee stock options.\nWhen calculating diluted earnings per share, the potential shares that would be outstanding if all outstanding stock options\nwere exercised are included. This number is different from outstanding stock options, which is included in Note 4, Stock Plans and\nShare-Based Compensation, because it is offset by shares CSX could repurchase using the proceeds from these hypothetical\nexercises to obtain the common stock equivalent.

The timing of share\nrepurchases depends upon management's assessment of marketplace conditions and other factors, and the program remains\nsubject to the discretion of the Board of Directors. Future share repurchases are expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash\ngenerated from operations and debt issuances. Shares are retired immediately upon repurchase. In accordance with the Equity\nTopic in the Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\"), the excess of repurchase price over par value is recorded in retained\nearnings.\nShare Repurchase Activity\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, CSX repurchased the following shares:\nYears Ended\n202220212020\nShares Repurchased (Units in Millions)\n151 90 38 \nCost of Shares (Dollars in Millions)$4,731 $2,886 $867 \nAverage Price Paid per Share$31.25 $31.91 $22.90 \nStructured Share Repurchases\nPeriodically, CSX enters into structured agreements for the repurchase of CSX shares.

The new shares were distributed after close of trading on June 28, 2021.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nNOTE 6.  Properties, continued\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Company’s capital investment includes purchased and self-constructed assets and property additions that substantially\nextend the service life or increase the utility of those assets. Indirect costs that can be specifically traced to capital projects are also\ncapitalized. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and expanding its network capacity\nfor long-term growth. Rail operations are capital intensive and CSX accounts for these costs in accordance with GAAP and the\nCompany’s capitalization policy. All properties are stated at historical cost less an allowance for accumulated depreciation.\nThe Company’s largest category of capital investment is the replacement of track assets and the acquisition or construction\nof new assets that enable CSX to enhance its operations or provide new capacity offerings to its customers. These construction\nprojects are primarily completed by CSXT employees. Costs for track asset replacement and capacity projects that are capitalized\ninclude:\n•labor costs, because many of the assets are self-constructed;\n•costs to purchase or construct new track or to prepare ground for the laying of track;\n•welding (rail, field and plant), which are processes used to connect segments of rail;\n•new ballast, which is gravel and crushed stone that holds track in line;\n•fuels and lubricants associated with tie, rail and surfacing work, which is the process of raising track to a designated\nelevation over an extended distance;\n•cross, switch and bridge ties, which are the braces that support the rails on a track;\n•gauging, which is the process of standardizing the distance between rails;\n•handling costs associated with installing rail, ties or ballast;\n•usage charge of machinery and equipment utilized in construction or installation; and\n•other track materials.\nLabor is a significant cost in self-constructed track replacement work. CSXT engineering employees directly charge their\nlabor to the track replacement project (the capitalized depreciable property). In replacing track, these employees concurrently\nperform deconstruction and installation of track material. Because of this concurrent process, CSX must estimate the amount of\nlabor that is related to deconstruction versus installation. As a component of the depreciation study for road and track assets,\nmanagement performs an analysis of labor costs related to the self-constructed track replacement work, which includes direct\nobservation  of  track  replacement  processes.  Through  this  analysis,  CSX  determined  that  approximately  20%  of  labor  costs\nassociated with track replacement is related to the deconstruction of old track, for which certain elements are expensed, and 80% is\nassociated with the installation of new track, which is capitalized.\nCapital investment related to locomotives and freight cars comprises the second largest category of the Company’s capital\nassets. This category includes purchases of locomotives and freight cars as well as certain equipment leases that are considered to\nbe  finance  leases  in  accordance  with  the Leases  Topic  in  the ASC.  In  addition,  costs  to  modify  or  rebuild  these  assets  are\ncapitalized if the investment incurred extends the asset’s service life or improves utilization. Improvement projects must meet\nspecified dollar thresholds to be capitalized and are reviewed by management to determine proper accounting treatment. Routine\nrepairs, overhauls and other maintenance costs, for all asset categories, are expensed as incurred.\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.72","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/154a3c81-ff7c-4cec-a7f2-fd79a60308f9.pdf","pdf_numpages":130,"loc":{"lines":{"from":2671,"to":2710}}}}],["d191f5fd-91a1-4278-9bd8-d8128935b037",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nNOTE 6.  Properties, continued\nDepreciation Method\nThe depreciable assets of the Company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting,\nwhich are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with GAAP. The Company depreciates its railroad assets, including\nmain-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method. Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise\n84% of total fixed assets of $48.1 billion on a gross basis as of December 2022. The remaining depreciable assets of the Company,\nincluding non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line method on a per asset basis.\nLand is not depreciated.\nThe group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these\ngroups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is used\nand depreciated to the end of its group’s recoverable life. The Company currently utilizes different depreciable asset categories to\naccount for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method. By utilizing various\ndepreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets.  All assets of the Company are\ndepreciated on a time or life basis.\nThe group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to the\nnature of most of its assets (e.g. track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most accurate\nand effective way to properly depreciate its assets.\nDepreciation Studies\nManagement performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method,\nthe service lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and\napplying management’s methods to determine the service lives of its properties. A depreciation study is the periodic review of asset\nservice lives, salvage values, accumulated depreciation, and other related factors for group assets conducted by a third-party\nspecialist, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved by the STB, the regulatory board that has broad jurisdiction over\nrailroad practices. The STB requires depreciation studies be performed every three years for equipment assets (e.g., locomotives\nand freight cars) and every six years for road and track assets (e.g., bridges, signals, rail, ties, and ballast). The Company believes\nthe frequency of depreciation studies currently required by the STB, complemented by annual data reviews conducted by a third-\nparty specialist and analyzed by the Company's management, provides adequate review of asset service lives and that a more\nfrequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of the assets.\nThe Company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2022, both\nof which resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets.\nThe 2022 equipment study resulted in an expected increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately $80 million primarily\ndue  to  deferred  losses  on  assets  depreciated  using  the  group-life  method.  Recent  experience  with  depreciation  studies  has\nresulted in changes to accumulated depreciation and depreciation rates that did not materially affect the Company's depreciation\nexpense of $1.4 billion in both 2021 and 2020.\n    \nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.73","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/154a3c81-ff7c-4cec-a7f2-fd79a60308f9.pdf","pdf_numpages":130,"loc":{"lines":{"from":2712,"to":2750}}}}],["9b01e5ea-6f31-48dd-9aec-7e11ba8f4be0",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nNOTE 6.  Properties, continued\nGroup-Life Assets Sales and Retirements\nSince the rail network is one contiguous, connected network it is impractical to maintain specific identification records for\nthese assets. For track assets (e.g., rail, ties, and ballast), CSX utilizes a first-in, first-out approach to asset retirements. Equipment\nassets (e.g., locomotives and freight cars) are specifically identified at retirement. When an equipment asset is retired that has been\ndepreciated using the group-life method, the cost is reduced from the cost base and recorded in accumulated depreciation.\nFor sales or retirements of assets depreciated under the group-life method that occur in the ordinary course of business, the\nasset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is immediately\nrecognized.  This  practice  is  consistent  with  accounting  treatment  prescribed  under  the  group-life  method.  As  part  of  the\ndepreciation study, an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient (or in\nexcess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess), including any deferred gains or losses,\nis amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next required\ndepreciation study. Since the overall assumption with the group-life method is that the assets within the group on average have the\nsame service life and characteristics, it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over time.\nFor sales or retirements of assets depreciated under the group-life method that do not occur in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, a gain or loss may be recognized if the sale or retirement meets each of the following three criteria: (i) it is unusual, (ii) it\nis material in amount, and (iii) it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies. No\nmaterial gains or losses were recognized on the sale of assets depreciated using the group-life method in 2022, 2021 or 2020, as\nno sales met the criteria described above.\nLand and Straight-line Assets Sales and Retirements\nWhen the Company sells or retires land, land-related easements or assets depreciated under the straight-line method, a\ngain or loss is recognized in purchased services and other on the consolidated statements of income. Primarily as a result of its\ninitiative to monetize non-core properties, the Company recognized gains on the sale of properties of $238 million, $454 million and\n$35 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSale of Property Rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three CSX-\nowned line segments to the Commonwealth of Virginia (“Commonwealth”) over three phases for a total of $525 million. The timing\nand amount of gains recognized were based on the allocation of fair value to each conveyance, the timing of future conveyances\nand collectability. In April 2021, upon closing of the first phase of the agreement, the Company collected $200 million in proceeds\nand recognized a $349 million gain. In fourth quarter 2021, the Company collected additional proceeds of $200 million, a portion of\nwhich was attributable to the first phase with the remainder attributable to the second phase. The second phase closed in January\n2022, which resulted in a $20 million gain in first quarter 2022.

Some of the Company’s lease arrangements contain lease components (e.g., minimum rent\npayments)  and  non-lease  components  (e.g.,  maintenance,  labor  charges,  etc.).  The  Company  generally  accounts  for  each\ncomponent separately based on the estimated standalone price of each component. For certain equipment leases, such as freight\ncar, vehicles and work equipment, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.\nCertain of the Company’s lease agreements include rental payments that are adjusted periodically for an index or rate. The\nleases are initially measured using the projected payments adjusted for the index or rate in effect at the commencement date. The\nCompany’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nOperating Leases\nOperating leases are included in right-of-use lease assets, other current liabilities and long-term lease liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. These assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of\nremaining lease payments over the lease term using the Company’s secured incremental borrowing rates or implicit rates, when\nreadily determinable. Short-term operating leases, which have an initial term of 12 months or less, are not recorded on the balance\nsheet.\nThe Company has various lease agreements with other parties with terms up to 50 years.

The class action lawsuits were consolidated into one case in federal court in the District of Columbia. In 2017, the\nDistrict Court issued its decision denying class certification. On August 16, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit\naffirmed the District Court’s ruling.\nThe consolidated case is now moving forward without class certification. Although the class was not certified, individual\nshippers have since brought claims against the railroads, which have been consolidated into a separate case.\nCSXT believes that its fuel surcharge practices were arrived at and applied lawfully and that the case is without merit.\nAccordingly, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously.

The Company’s performance obligation arises when it\nreceives a bill of lading (“BOL”) to transport a customer's commodities at a negotiated price contained in a transportation services\nagreement or a publicly disclosed tariff rate. Once a BOL is received, a contract is formed whereby the parties are committed to\nperform, collectability of consideration is probable and the rights of the parties, shipping terms and conditions, and payment terms\nare identified.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nNOTE 11. Revenues, continued\nThe  average  transit  time  to  complete  a  rail  shipment  is  between  2  to  8  days  depending  on  market.  Payments  for\ntransportation services are normally billed once a BOL is received and are generally due within 15 days after the invoice date. The\nCompany recognizes revenue over transit time of freight as it moves from origin to destination. Revenue for services started but not\ncompleted at the reporting date is allocated based on the relative transit time in each reporting period, with the portion allocated for\nservices subsequent to the reporting date considered remaining performance obligations.\nThe certain key estimates included in the recognition and measurement of revenue and related accounts receivable are as\nfollows:\n•Revenue associated with shipments in transit, which is recognized ratably over transit time and is based on average cycle\ntimes to move commodities and products from their origin to their final destination or interchange;\n•Adjustments to revenue for billing corrections and billing discounts;\n•Adjustments to revenue for overcharge claims filed by customers, which are based on historical payments to customers for\nrate overcharges as a percentage of total billing; and\n•Incentive-based refunds to customers, which are primarily volume-related, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on the\nbasis of the projected liability (this estimate is based on historical activity, current volume levels and forecasted future\nvolume).\nRevenue related to interline transportation services that involve the services of another party, such as another railroad, is\nreported on a net basis. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to another party is not\nreflected as revenue.\nEffective  third  quarter  2021,  trucking  revenue  includes  revenue  from  the  operations  of  Quality  Carriers  and  is  mostly\ncomprised of truck shipments of chemicals. A performance obligation arises when Quality Carriers receives a customer order to\ntransport a commodity at a contracted rate. Revenue is recorded on a gross basis ratably over transit time.\nOther revenue is recorded upon completion of the service and is comprised of revenue from regional subsidiary railroads\nand incidental charges, including intermodal storage and equipment usage, demurrage and switching. Revenue from regional\nsubsidiary railroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Intermodal storage represents\ncharges for customer storage of containers at an intermodal terminal, ramp facility or offsite location beyond a specified period of\ntime. Demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held by a customer beyond a specified period of time.\nSwitching represents charges assessed when a railroad switches cars for a customer or another railroad.\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to\nchanges in transaction price) was not material.\nCSX 2022 Form 10-K p.94","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/154a3c81-ff7c-4cec-a7f2-fd79a60308f9.pdf","pdf_numpages":130,"loc":{"lines":{"from":3468,"to":3501}}}}],["da4c89b9-791d-4b1a-8dbc-004e3df62762",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nItem 8.

The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the\nrisk associated with investing in these securities. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:\n•Level 1 – observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;\n•Level 2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk,\netc.); and\n•Level 3 – significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market\nparticipants would use in determining the fair value of investments).\nThe valuation methods described below may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable\nvalue  or  reflective  of  future  fair  values.

We encourage you to read CSX’s amended and\nrestated articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as applicable provisions of the VSCA, for more information.\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nThe authorized capital stock of CSX is (i) 5,400,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, and (ii) 25,000,000\nshares of preferred stock, without par value, issuable in series.\nCommon Stock\nListing. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “CSX.”\nFully Paid and Non-Assessable. All outstanding shares of common stock are fully-paid and non-assessable. Any additional shares\nof common stock we issue will also be fully-paid and non-assessable.\nVoting Rights. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters voted on by shareholders, and, except as\notherwise required by law or provided by the terms of any series of preferred stock, the holders of those shares exclusively possess\nall voting power of CSX. No holder of common stock is entitled as such, as a matter of right, to subscribe for or purchase any\nshares of common stock or preferred stock. There is no cumulative voting in the election of directors, who are elected annually by a\nvote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to a nominee’s election; provided, that if there are more nominees for election\nthan the number of directors to be elected, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast in such an election.\nDividends. Subject to the preferential rights of any outstanding series of preferred stock, the holders of common stock are entitled\nto receive ratably dividends as may be declared from time to time by our Board of Directors from funds legally available for that\npurpose.\nRight to Receive Liquidation Distributions. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of CSX, holders of common stock\nare entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment or provision for liabilities and amounts owing in respect of any\noutstanding preferred stock.\nTransfer Agent.

No holder of preferred\nstock will be entitled, as a matter of right, to subscribe for or purchase any shares of preferred stock or common stock.\nUnless otherwise determined by our Board of Directors, any series of preferred stock will rank, with respect to dividends and the\ndistribution of assets, senior to common stock, and on a parity with shares of any other then outstanding series of preferred stock.\nTherefore, any preferred stock that may subsequently be issued may limit the rights of the holders of our common stock and\npreferred stock. In addition, under certain circumstances, preferred stock could also restrict dividend payments to our holders of\ncommon stock.\nVirginia Stock Corporation Act; Anti-takeover Effects\nThe VSCA contains provisions governing “Affiliated Transactions.” These provisions, with several exceptions discussed below,\ngenerally require approval of certain material transactions between a Virginia corporation and any beneficial holder of more than\n10% of any class of its outstanding voting shares (an “Interested Shareholder”) by a majority of disinterested directors and by the\nholders of at least two-thirds of the remaining voting shares. Affiliated Transactions subject to this approval requirement include\nmergers, share exchanges, material dispositions of corporate assets not in the ordinary course of business, any dissolution of the\ncorporation  proposed  by  or  on  behalf  of  an  Interested  Shareholder,  or  any  reclassification,  including  a  reverse  stock  split,\nrecapitalization  or  merger  of  the  corporation  with  its  subsidiaries,  which  increases  the  percentage  of  voting  shares  owned\nbeneficially by an Interested Shareholder by more than 5%.","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/154a3c81-ff7c-4cec-a7f2-fd79a60308f9.pdf","pdf_numpages":130,"loc":{"lines":{"from":4583,"to":4612}}}}],["7ad33dcd-29b3-44a7-bb44-33964cd4964a",{"pageContent":"For three years following the time that a person becomes an Interested Shareholder, a Virginia corporation cannot engage in an\nAffiliated Transaction with that Interested Shareholder without the approval of two-thirds of the voting shares other than those\nshares  beneficially  owned  by  the  Interested  Shareholder,  and  the  approval  of  a  majority  of  the  Disinterested  Directors.\n“Disinterested Director” means, with respect to a particular Interested Shareholder, a member of our Board of Directors who was:\n•a member before the date on which an Interested Shareholder became an Interested Shareholder, or\n•recommended  for  election  by,  or  was  elected  to  fill  a  vacancy  and  received  the  affirmative  vote  of,  a  majority  of  the\nDisinterested Directors then on the Board of Directors.\nAfter the expiration of the three-year period, the statute requires approval of Affiliated Transactions by two-thirds of the voting\nshares other than those beneficially owned by the Interested Shareholder.\nThe principal exceptions to the special voting requirements apply to transactions proposed after the three-year period has expired\nand require either that the transaction be approved by a majority of CSX’s Disinterested Directors or that the transaction satisfy the\nfair-price requirements of the statute. In general, the fair-price requirement provides that in a two-step acquisition transaction, the\nInterested Shareholder must pay the shareholders in the second step either the same amount of cash or the same amount and\ntype of consideration paid to acquire CSX’s shares in the first step.\nNone of the limitations and special voting requirements described above applies to an Interested Shareholder whose acquisition of\nshares making that person an Interested Shareholder was approved by a majority of CSX’s Disinterested Directors.\nThese provisions are designed to deter certain types of takeovers of Virginia corporations. The statute provides that, by affirmative\nvote of a majority of the voting shares other than shares owned by any Interested Shareholder, a corporation can adopt an\namendment to its articles of incorporation or bylaws providing that the Affiliated Transactions provisions will not apply to the\ncorporation. At the 2006 annual meeting, the shareholders of CSX voted to “opt out” of the Affiliated Transactions provisions of the\nVSCA. Under CSX’s amended and restated articles of incorporation, the following actions must be approved by the affirmative vote\nof  a  majority  of  the  voting  shares  entitled  to  vote:  (1)  any  plan  of  merger  or  share  exchange  for  which  the  VSCA  requires\nshareholder approval; (2) the sale of all or substantially all of CSX’s property for which the VSCA requires shareholder approval;\nand (3) the dissolution of CSX. Majority voting for these three types of actions became effective on November 3, 2007, 18 months\nafter the amendment was approved by the shareholders.\nThe VSCA also generally provides that shares of a Virginia corporation acquired in a transaction that would cause the acquiring\nperson’s voting strength to meet or exceed any of three thresholds (20%, 33-1/3% or 50%) have no voting rights with respect to\nthose shares unless granted by a majority vote of shares not owned by the acquiring person or any officer or employee-director of\nthe corporation.

Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as “will,” \n“should,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “estimate,” “preliminary” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are \nmade, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. If the company updates any forward-looking statement, no \ninference should be drawn that the company will make additional updates with respect to that statement or any other forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual performance or results could differ materially from that anticipated by any \nforward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements include, among \nothers; (i) the company’s success in implementing its financial and operational initiatives; (ii) changes in domestic or international economic, political or business \nconditions, including those affecting the transportation industry (such as the impact of industry competition, conditions, performance and consolidation); (iii) legislative or \nregulatory changes; (iv) the inherent business risks associated with safety and security; (v) the outcome of claims and litigation involving or affecting the company; (vi) \nnatural events such as severe weather conditions or pandemic health crises; and (vii) the inherent uncertainty associated with projecting economic and business \nconditions.\nOther important assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are specified in the company’s \nSEC reports, accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and the company’s website at www.csx.com. \n2023 FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL\n\nNon-GAAP Measures Disclosure\n3\nCSX reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America(U.S. GAAP).CSX also uses certain non-\nGAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the \nfinancial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results.\nNon-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by U.S. GAAP.Therefore, CSX’s non-GAAP measures areunlikely to be comparable to \nsimilar measures presented by other companies.The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as \nsuperior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP.

Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies\nBackground\nCSX Corporation together with its subsidiaries (\"CSX\" or the “Company”), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nation's\nleading transportation companies. The Company provides rail-based transportation services including traditional rail service, the transport\nof intermodal containers and trailers, as well as other transportation services such as rail-to-truck transfers and bulk commodity operations.\n    CSX's principal operating subsidiary, CSX Transportation, Inc. (“CSXT”), provides an important link to the transportation supply chain\nthrough its approximately 20,000 route mile rail network and serves major population centers in 26 states east of the Mississippi River, the\nDistrict of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The Company's intermodal business links customers to railroads\nvia trucks and terminals. On June 1, 2022, CSX completed its acquisition of Pan Am Systems, Inc. (“Pan Am”) which is the parent\ncompany of Pan Am Railways, Inc. This acquisition expands CSXT’s reach in the Northeastern United States.\nCSXT is also responsible for the Company's real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development activities.\nSubstantially all of these activities are focused on supporting railroad operations.\nOther entities\n    In addition to CSXT, the Company’s subsidiaries include Quality Carriers, Inc. (\"Quality Carriers\"), CSX Intermodal Terminals, Inc. (“CSX\nIntermodal Terminals”), Total Distribution Services, Inc. (“TDSI”), Transflo Terminal Services, Inc. (“Transflo”), CSX Technology, Inc. (“CSX\nTechnology”) and other subsidiaries. Effective July 1, 2021, CSX acquired Quality Carriers, the largest provider of bulk liquid chemicals\ntruck transportation in North America, from Quality Distribution, Inc. For further details, refer to Note 11, Business Combinations. CSX\nIntermodal Terminals owns and operates a system of intermodal terminals, predominantly in the eastern United States and also performs\ndrayage services (the pickup and delivery of intermodal shipments) for certain customers. TDSI serves the automotive industry with\ndistribution centers and storage locations. Transflo connects non-rail served customers to the many benefits of rail by transferring products\nfrom rail to trucks. The biggest Transflo markets are chemicals and agriculture, which includes shipments of plastics and ethanol. CSX\nTechnology and other subsidiaries provide support services for the Company.\nSale of Property Rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three CSX-owned line\nsegments to the Commonwealth of Virginia (“Commonwealth”) over three phases for a total of $525 million. The timing and amount of\ngains recognized are based on the allocation of fair value to each conveyance, the timing of future conveyances and collectability. In April\n2021, upon closing of the first phase of the agreement, the Company collected $200 million in proceeds and recognized a $349 million\ngain. In fourth quarter 2021, the Company collected additional proceeds of $200 million, a portion of which was attributable to the first\nphase with the remainder attributable to the second phase. The second phase closed in January 2022, which resulted in a $20 million gain\nin first quarter 2022. During June 2022, the final $125 million of proceeds was approved by the Commonwealth, which resulted in a\n$122 million gain in second quarter 2022 related to property rights previously conveyed. These proceeds are expected to be collected\nduring fourth quarter 2022 upon closing of the third phase. As of June 30, 2022, the carrying values of the remaining assets subject to this\ntransaction were not material.\nCSX Q2 2022 Form 10-Q p.8","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/7c62d325-406a-4369-8797-f6095c7f0fa4.pdf","pdf_numpages":52,"loc":{"lines":{"from":318,"to":355}}}}],["65895e1e-8cf6-4022-8d5a-77f3b7a4e840",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 1.    Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies, continued\nBasis of Presentation\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all normal, recurring adjustments\nnecessary to fairly present the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Where applicable, prior year information has\nbeen reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”), certain information and disclosures normally included in the notes to the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) have been omitted from these interim financial statements. CSX suggests that\nthese financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes included in CSX's most recent annual\nreport on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed current reports on Form 8-K.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company's fiscal periods are based upon the calendar year. Except as otherwise specified, references to “second quarter(s)”\nor “six months” indicate CSX's fiscal periods ending June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, and references to \"year-end\" indicate the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2021.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn  March  2020,  the  Financial Accounting  Standards  Board  (\"FASB\")  issued Accounting  Standards  Update  (\"ASU\")  2020-04,\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. As the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") will no longer\nbe available beginning July 2023, this standard update provides practical expedients for contract modifications made as part of the\ntransition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates. CSX's revolving line of credit currently uses LIBOR as a reference rate. This standard\nupdate can be adopted prospectively through December 31, 2022. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of this standard update,\nbut does not anticipate that adoption will have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Disclosure by Business Entities about Government Assistance. This standard\nupdate requires annual disclosure of the nature of any government assistance received, accounting policies related to such assistance and\nthe effect of that assistance on the entity’s financial statements. The Company will adopt this guidance effective year end 2022 and the\nstandard update will not impact the Company's results of operations or financial position as the update only impacts disclosures.\nCSX Q2 2022 Form 10-Q p.9","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/7c62d325-406a-4369-8797-f6095c7f0fa4.pdf","pdf_numpages":52,"loc":{"lines":{"from":357,"to":385}}}}],["5428d076-a861-4f6a-a4d1-fe2d5d2cc884",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 2.

Earnings per share,\nassuming dilution, is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and common stock equivalents\nadjusted for the effects of common stock that may be issued as a result of potentially dilutive instruments.

The average\nannual operating income growth percentage and CCE measures over the plan period will each comprise 50% of the payout and will be\nmeasured independently of the other. As defined under the plan, CCE is a cash-flow based measure that incentivizes strategic investments\nearning more than the required return. CCE equals CSX’s gross cash earnings (after-tax EBITDA) minus the required return on gross\noperating assets.\n    Grants were made in performance units, with each unit representing the right to receive one share of CSX common stock, and payouts\nwill be made in CSX common stock.

Should a number of these items occur in the same period, however, their combined effect could be material in that\nparticular period.\nCasualty\n     Casualty reserves of $188 million and $180 million as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, represent accruals for\npersonal injury, occupational disease and occupational injury claims primarily related to railroad operations. Beginning June 1, 2021, the\nCompany's  self-insured  retention  amount  for  these  claims  increased  from  $75  million  to  $100  million  per  occurrence.  Currently,  no\nindividual claim is expected to exceed the self-insured retention amount. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, to the\nextent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis\nwith a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes\nin estimate. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and\nuncertainties in litigation.

Work-related  injuries  for  CSXT\nemployees  are  primarily  subject  to  the  Federal  Employers’  Liability  Act  (“FELA”).  CSXT  retains  an  independent  actuary  to  assist\nmanagement in assessing the value of personal injury claims. An analysis is performed by the actuary quarterly and is reviewed by\nmanagement.

The\nCompany is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving\nprivate  parties  and  regulatory  agencies.  The  Company  has  been  identified  as  a  potentially  responsible  party  at  approximately  230\nenvironmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental\nResponse, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\"), also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these\nproceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these\nproceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or\noperated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company's land holdings were leased to others for\ncommercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property\nand could give rise to proceedings against the Company.\nIn any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as\nwell as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and\noperators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial.\nIn accordance with the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with\nrespect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:\n•type of clean-up required;\n•nature of the Company's alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the\nsite);\n•extent of the Company's alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and\n•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.\nCSX Q2 2022 Form 10-Q p.16","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/7c62d325-406a-4369-8797-f6095c7f0fa4.pdf","pdf_numpages":52,"loc":{"lines":{"from":598,"to":631}}}}],["0d2ffabc-1aa9-434d-9ddc-12194f5693f1",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 4.

Environmental remediation costs are included in purchased services and other on the consolidated income\nstatements.\nCurrently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any,\non some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given\nlocation,  result  in  additional  exposure,  the  amount  and  materiality  of  which  cannot  presently  be  reasonably  estimated.

Also included in other reserves are\nlongshoremen disability claims related to a previously owned international shipping business (these claims are in runoff) as well as claims\nfor current port employees.\nNOTE 5.    Commitments and Contingencies\nInsurance\n    The Company maintains insurance programs with substantial limits for property damage, including resulting business interruption, and\nthird-party liability. A certain amount of risk is retained by the Company on each insurance program. Under its property insurance program,\nthe Company retains all risk up to $100 million per occurrence for losses from floods and named windstorms and up to $75 million per\noccurrence for other property losses. For third-party liability claims, the Company retains all risk up to $100 million per occurrence. As CSX\nnegotiates insurance coverage above its full self-retention amounts, it retains a percentage of risk at various layers of coverage. While the\nCompany believes its insurance coverage is adequate, future claims could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not\ncontinue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.\nCSX Q2 2022 Form 10-Q p.17","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/7c62d325-406a-4369-8797-f6095c7f0fa4.pdf","pdf_numpages":52,"loc":{"lines":{"from":633,"to":663}}}}],["0edf64a3-2666-4f6d-b627-a2e2559f9c22",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 5.    Commitments and Contingencies, continued\nLegal\n    The Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various\ngovernmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel surcharge practices, tax matters,\nenvironmental and hazardous material exposure matters, FELA and labor claims by current or former employees, other personal injury or\nproperty claims and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges. Some of the legal proceedings include\nclaims for compensatory as well as punitive damages and others are, or are purported to be, class actions. While the final outcome of\nthese matters cannot be predicted with certainty, considering, among other things, the legal defenses available and liabilities that have\nbeen recorded along with applicable insurance, it is currently the opinion of management that none of these pending items is likely to have\na material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. An unexpected adverse resolution of one\nor more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or\nliquidity in that particular period.\n    The Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss for certain legal proceedings for which a loss is reasonably possible in excess\nof reserves established. The Company has estimated this range to be $2 million to $20 million in aggregate at June 30, 2022. This\nestimated  aggregate  range  is  based  upon  currently  available  information  and  is  subject  to  significant  judgment  and  a  variety  of\nassumptions. Accordingly, the Company's estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current\nestimate.\nFuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation\n    In May 2007, class action lawsuits were filed against CSXT and three other U.S.-based Class I railroads alleging that the defendants'\nfuel surcharge practices relating to contract and unregulated traffic resulted from an illegal conspiracy in violation of antitrust laws. The\nclass action lawsuits were consolidated into one case in federal court in the District of Columbia. In 2017, the District Court issued its\ndecision denying class certification. On August 16, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the District Court’s ruling.\n    The consolidated case is now moving forward without class certification. Although a class was not certified, shippers other than those\nwho brought the original lawsuit in 2007 must decide whether to bring their own individual claim against one or more railroads. Individual\nshipper claims filed to date have been consolidated into a separate case.\n    CSXT believes that its fuel surcharge practices were arrived at and applied lawfully and that the case is without merit. Accordingly, the\nCompany intends to defend itself vigorously. However, penalties for violating antitrust laws can be severe, and resolution of these matters\nindividually or when aggregated could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity\nin that particular period.\nCSX Q2 2022 Form 10-Q p.18","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/7c62d325-406a-4369-8797-f6095c7f0fa4.pdf","pdf_numpages":52,"loc":{"lines":{"from":665,"to":698}}}}],["fcd3d6fe-8ef8-4781-822a-23186822726a",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 5.

The  Property,  which  was  formerly  owned  by\nPharmacia,  is  now  owned  by  CSXT.  CSXT's  indemnification  and  defense  duties  arise  with  respect  to  several  matters.  The  U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), using its CERCLA authority, seeks the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances in the\n17-mile Lower Passaic River Study Area (the \"Study Area”). CSXT, on behalf of Pharmacia, and a significant number of other potentially\nresponsible parties are together conducting a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study of the Study Area pursuant to an Administrative\nSettlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA. Pharmacia’s share of responsibility, indemnified by CSXT, for the investigation\nand cleanup costs of the Study Area may be determined through various mechanisms including (a) an allocation and settlement with EPA;\n(b) litigation brought by EPA against non-settling parties; or (c) litigation among the responsible parties.\nFor the lower 8 miles of the Study Area, EPA issued its Record of Decision detailing the agency’s mandated remedial process in\nMarch 2016. Approximately 80 parties, including Pharmacia, are participating in an EPA-directed allocation and settlement process to\nassign responsibility for the remedy selected for the lower 8 miles of the Study Area. CSXT is participating in the EPA-directed allocation\nand settlement process on behalf of Pharmacia.\nFor the remainder of the Study Area, EPA has selected an interim remedy in a Record of Decision dated September 28, 2021.\nSettlement discussions are also ongoing for the selected interim remedy. On March 2, 2022, EPA issued a Notice Letter to Pharmacia,\nOccidental  Chemical  Corporation  and  eight  other  parties  alleging  they  are  liable  under  Section  107(a)  of  CERCLA  for  releases  or\nthreatened releases of hazardous substances and requesting each party, individually or collectively, submit good faith offers to EPA in\nconnection with the Study Area. CSX, on behalf of Pharmacia, responded to the Notice Letter and submitted a good faith offer to EPA on\nJune 27, 2022, following meetings with a mediator from EPA’s Conflict Prevention and Resolution Center. Negotiations with EPA and other\nparties to resolve this matter continue.\n    CSXT is also defending and indemnifying Pharmacia with regard to the Property in litigation filed by Occidental Chemical Corporation,\nwhich is seeking to recover various costs. These costs include costs for the remedial design of the lower 8 miles of the Study Area, as well\nas anticipated costs associated with the future remediation of the entire Study Area. Alternatively, Occidental seeks to compel some, or all\nof the defendants to participate in the remediation of the Study Area. Pharmacia is one of approximately 110 defendants in this federal\nlawsuit filed by Occidental on June 30, 2018.\n    CSXT is also defending and indemnifying Pharmacia in a cooperative natural resource damages assessment process related to the\nProperty. Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe any indemnification or remediation costs potentially\nallocable to CSXT with respect to the Property and the Study Area would be material to the Company's financial condition, results of\noperations or liquidity.\nCSX Q2 2022 Form 10-Q p.19","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/7c62d325-406a-4369-8797-f6095c7f0fa4.pdf","pdf_numpages":52,"loc":{"lines":{"from":700,"to":735}}}}],["ba9fe700-5702-480d-b21f-874239c8701b",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 6.

Revenues, continued\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates revenue from rail freight billings under contracts with customers generally on a rate per carload, container\nor ton-basis based on length of haul and commodities carried. The Company’s performance obligation arises when it receives a bill of\nlading (“BOL”) to transport a customer's commodities at a negotiated price contained in a transportation services agreement or a publicly\ndisclosed  tariff  rate.  Once  a  BOL  is  received,  a  contract  is  formed  whereby  the  parties  are  committed  to  perform,  collectability  of\nconsideration is probable and the rights of the parties, shipping terms and conditions, and payment terms are identified. A customer may\nsubmit several BOLs for transportation services at various times throughout a service agreement term but each shipment represents a\ndistinct service that is a separately identified performance obligation.\nThe average transit time to complete a rail shipment is between 2 to 8 days depending on market. Payments for transportation\nservices are normally billed once a BOL is received and are generally due within 15 days after the invoice date. The Company recognizes\nrevenue over transit time of freight as it moves from origin to destination. Revenue for services started but not completed at the reporting\ndate is allocated based on the relative transit time in each reporting period, with the portion allocated for services subsequent to the\nreporting date considered remaining performance obligations.\nThe certain key estimates included in the recognition and measurement of revenue and related accounts receivable are as follows:\n•revenue associated with shipments in transit, which is recognized ratably over transit time and is based on average cycle times to\nmove commodities and products from their origin to their final destination or interchange;\n•adjustments to revenue for billing corrections and billing discounts;\n•adjustments to revenue for overcharge claims filed by customers, which are based on historical payments to customers for rate\novercharges as a percentage of total billing; and\n•incentive-based refunds to customers, which are primarily volume-related, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on the basis of\nthe projected liability (this estimate is based on historical activity, current volume levels and forecasted future volume).\nRevenue related to interline transportation services that involve the services of another party, such as another railroad, is reported\non a net basis. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to another party is not reflected as\nrevenue.\nEffective third quarter 2021, trucking revenue includes revenue from the operations of Quality Carriers. This revenue is mostly\ncomprised of truck shipments of chemicals and is recorded ratably over transit time.\nOther revenue is recorded upon completion of the service and is comprised of revenue from regional subsidiary railroads and\nincidental  charges,  including  intermodal  storage  and  equipment  usage,  demurrage  and  switching.  Revenue  from  regional  subsidiary\nrailroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Intermodal storage represents charges for customer\nstorage of containers at an intermodal terminal, ramp facility or offsite location beyond a specified period of time. Demurrage represents\ncharges assessed when freight cars are held by a customer beyond a specified period of time. Switching represents charges assessed\nwhen a railroad switches cars for a customer or another railroad.\nCSX Q2 2022 Form 10-Q p.23","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/7c62d325-406a-4369-8797-f6095c7f0fa4.pdf","pdf_numpages":52,"loc":{"lines":{"from":870,"to":907}}}}],["e337aa6a-78ce-41b9-8cd0-bf4f36e58ae2",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 8.

For CSX, this statement applies to certain investments, long-term debt and interest rate derivatives. Disclosure of\nthe fair value of pension plan assets is only required annually. Also, this rule clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting,\nestablishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements.\nVarious inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company's investments, pension plan assets, long-term debt and\ninterest rate derivatives. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated\nwith investing in these securities. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.\n•Level 1 - observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;\n•Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.); and\n•Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Company's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants\nwould use in determining the fair value of investments).\nThe valuation methods described below may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or\nreflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other\nmarket participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could\nresult in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nInvestments\n    The Company's investment assets are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the Fair Value\nMeasurements and Disclosures Topic in the ASC.

The majority of the Company's long-term debt is valued with assistance from\na third party that utilizes closing transactions, market quotes or market values of comparable debt. For those instruments not valued by the\nthird party, the fair value has been estimated by applying market rates of similar instruments to the scheduled contractual debt payments\nand maturities. These market rates are provided by the same third party. All of the inputs used to determine the fair value of the Company's\nlong-term debt are Level 2 inputs.\nThe fair value of outstanding debt fluctuates with changes in a number of factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to,\ninterest rates, market conditions, credit ratings, values of similar financial instruments, size of the transaction, cash flow projections and\ncomparable trades.

The  results  of  Quality  Carriers'\noperations and its cash flows were consolidated prospectively.\nGoodwill recognized in the acquisition of $213 million was calculated as the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of\nnet assets assumed as of July 1, 2021 and relates primarily to the ability of CSX to extend the reach of its network and gain access to new\nproducts, markets, and regions through a unique and competitive multimodal solution that leverages the reach of truck transportation with\nthe cost advantage of rail-based services. The goodwill recognized is deductible for tax purposes. Intangible assets acquired totaled\n$180 million and consisted of $150 million of customer relationships and $30 million of trade names amortized over a weighted-average\nperiod  of  20  years  and  15  years,  respectively.  The  purchase  price  allocation  was  finalized  as  of  December  31,  2021,  and  total\nmeasurement period adjustments to the preliminary allocation were immaterial.\nThis acquisition is not material with respect to the Company’s financial statements when reviewed under the quantitative and\nqualitative considerations of Regulation S-X Article 11 and ASC Topic 805. As the acquisition is not material, CSX has not provided pro\nforma information relating to the pre-acquisition period.\nOther Acquisitions\nDuring the six months 2022, Quality Carriers completed several acquisitions of previous independent affiliates that were immaterial\nindividually and in aggregate.\nCSX Q2 2022 Form 10-Q p.29","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/7c62d325-406a-4369-8797-f6095c7f0fa4.pdf","pdf_numpages":52,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1122,"to":1152}}}}],["ed277152-5f9d-43c8-abfa-540f6be4113c",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 12.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-GAAP Measures - Unaudited\n    CSX reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.\nGAAP). CSX also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G\nand Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior\nreported results.  Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s non-\nGAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP\nmeasures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance\nwith GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are below.\nFree Cash Flow\n    Management believes that free cash flow is supplemental information useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s\nfinancial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure\nrepresents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on\noutstanding debt. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and proceeds and\nadvances from property dispositions. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by\noperating activities. The decrease in free cash flow before dividends from the prior year of $123 million is due to a decrease in proceeds\nfrom property dispositions driven by the timing of payments related to the sale of property rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia as well\nas higher property additions, partially offset by an increase in cash from operating activities.\n    The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow, before dividends (non-GAAP\nmeasure). \nSix Months\n(Dollars in millions)20222021\nNet cash provided by operating activities$2,530 $2,399 \nProperty Additions(811)(754)\nProceeds and Advances from Property Dispositions29 227 \nOther Investing Activities n/a(1)\nFree Cash Flow (before payment of dividends)\n$1,748 $1,871 \n(a) Effective first quarter 2022, the results of other investing activities are no longer included in free cash flow.

Training  and  safety  programs  are  designed  to  prevent  incidents  that  can  adversely  impact  employees,  customers  and\ncommunities. Technological innovations that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents are designed to serve as an\nadditional  layer  of  protection  for  the  Company's  employees.  Continued  capital  investment  in  the  Company's  assets,  including  track,\nbridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.\nIn second quarter 2022, velocity decreased by 15% and dwell increased by 12% versus prior year.

The Company also has a commercial paper program, backed\nby the revolving credit facility, under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate\nprincipal  amount  of  $1.0  billion  outstanding  at  any  one  time. At  June  30,  2022,  the  Company  had  no  outstanding  debt  under  the\ncommercial paper program.\n    Planned capital investments for 2022 are expected to be approximately $2.0 billion. Of the 2022 investment, over 80% is expected to be\nused to sustain the core infrastructure and operating equipment. The remaining amounts will be used to promote profitable growth,\nincluding projects supporting service enhancements and productivity initiatives. CSX intends to fund capital investments primarily through\ncash generated from operations.\nMaterial Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Working Capital\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n    Total assets decreased $165 million from year end primarily due to the $1.5 billion decrease in cash described above, which was\npartially offset by a $629 million increase in net properties, a $341 million increase in accounts receivables, a $153 million increase in\ninvestments in affiliates and other companies, and a $106 million increase in goodwill. The increase in net property was primarily due to\n$536 million in fixed assets acquired as part of the Pan Am transaction. Of the increase in accounts receivables, $124 million was related\nto the sale of property rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia and the remainder was commensurate with the increase in revenue. In\naddition, the increase in investments in affiliates and other companies includes the impact of the acquired interest in Pan Am Southern,\nLLC. See Note 11, Business Combinations, for more details on purchase accounting and Note 12, Goodwill and Other Intangibles, for\nmore details on additions to goodwill.\nTotal  liabilities  increased  $194  million  from  year  end  primarily  due  to  an  increase  in  deferred  taxes  of  $209  million  due  to\naccelerated tax depreciation and the impact of the Pan Am acquisition as well as an increase in accounts payable of $92 million. These\nincreases were partially offset by debt repayments of $93 million. Total shareholders' equity decreased $359 million from year end primarily\ndriven by share repurchases of $2.5 billion and dividends paid of $433 million, partially offset by net earnings of $2.0 billion and common\nstock issued to acquire Pan Am of $422 million.\nWorking capital is considered a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of\n$391 million as of June 30, 2022 and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1.2 billion since year end. The decrease in\ncurrent assets was primarily due to the decrease in cash of $1.5 billion, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $341\nmillion as described above. The increase in current liabilities was primarily the result of a $92 million increase in accounts payable and a\n$55 million increase in current maturities of long-term debt. The Company's working capital balance varies due to factors such as the\ntiming of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed above. The Company continues to\nmaintain adequate liquidity to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCSX is committed to returning cash to shareholders and maintaining an investment-grade credit profile. Capital structure, capital\ninvestments and cash distributions, including dividends and share repurchases, are reviewed at least annually by the Board of Directors.\nManagement's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and volume of repurchases. Future share repurchases\nare expected to be funded by cash on hand, cash generated from operations and debt issuances.\nCompleted and Pending Transactions\nAcquisition of Pan Am Systems, Inc.\nOn June 1, 2022, CSX acquired Pan Am for a purchase price of $601 million funded through a combination of common stock and\ncash, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments. For further details, refer to Note 11, Business Combinations.\nAcquisition of Quality Carriers, Inc.\nOn July 1, 2021, CSX acquired Quality Carriers for a purchase price of $541 million in cash, net of $3 million cash acquired. For\nfurther details, refer to Note 11, Business Combinations.\nSale of Property Rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three CSX-owned line\nsegments to the Commonwealth of Virginia (“Commonwealth”) over three phases for a total of $525 million. The timing and amount of\ngains recognized are based on the allocation of fair value to each conveyance, the timing of future conveyances and collectability. In April\n2021, upon closing of the first phase of the agreement, the Company collected $200 million in proceeds and recognized a $349 million\ngain. In fourth quarter 2021, the Company collected additional proceeds of $200 million, a portion of which was attributable to the first\nphase with the remainder attributable to the second phase. The second phase closed in January 2022, which resulted in a $20 million gain\nin first quarter 2022. During June 2022, the final $125 million of proceeds was approved by the Commonwealth, which resulted in a $122\nmillion gain in second quarter 2022 related to property rights previously conveyed. These proceeds are expected to be collected during\nfourth quarter 2022 upon closing of the third phase.\nCSX Q2 2022 Form 10-Q p.40","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/7c62d325-406a-4369-8797-f6095c7f0fa4.pdf","pdf_numpages":52,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1527,"to":1551}}}}],["18d1d107-3a3d-44bb-9fd9-ea2306e0dc93",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGuaranteed Notes Issued By CSXT\nIn 2007, CSXT, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSX Corporation, issued in a registered public offering $381 million of secured\nequipment notes maturing in 2023. CSX Corporation has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes. At CSXT’s option, CSXT may\nredeem any or all of the notes, in whole or in part, at any time, at the redemption price including premium. In the case of loss or destruction\nof any item of equipment securing the notes, if CSXT does not substitute another item of equipment for the item suffering such loss or\ndestruction, CSXT will be required to redeem the notes in part at par. The guarantee of the notes will rank equally in right of payment with\nall existing and future senior obligations of CSX Corporation and will be effectively subordinated to all future secured indebtedness of CSX\nCorporation to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. The guarantee is subject to release in limited circumstances only upon\nthe occurrence of certain customary conditions. As of June 30, 2022, the principal balance of these secured equipment notes was $149\nmillion.\nIn  accordance  with  SEC  rules,  including  amendments  adopted  in  2020,  CSX  is  not  required  to  present  separate  condensed\nconsolidating financial information for wholly-owned subsidiaries who issued or guaranteed notes. Additionally, presentation of combined\nsummary financial information regarding subsidiary issuers and guarantors is not required because the assets, liabilities and results of\noperations of the combined issuers and guarantors of the notes are not materially different from the corresponding amounts presented in\nthe consolidated financial statements.\nLABOR AGREEMENTS\n    Approximately 16,500 of the Company's approximately 21,700 employees are members of a labor union. For the 13 rail unions that\nparticipate in national bargaining, a round of negotiations for benefits, wages and work rules is underway. Typically, these negotiations take\nseveral years. Current agreements remain in place until modified by new agreements or until procedures outlined under the Railway Labor\nAct (\"RLA\") are exhausted. RLA procedures include mediation, potential arbitration, cooling-off periods, and the possibility of presidential\nand congressional intervention.\nCSX Q2 2022 Form 10-Q p.41","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/7c62d325-406a-4369-8797-f6095c7f0fa4.pdf","pdf_numpages":52,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1553,"to":1577}}}}],["ad966e61-5279-4f18-9b34-04396f7dac81",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires\nthat  management  make  estimates  in  reporting  the  amounts  of  certain  assets  and  liabilities,  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThere  have  been  no  material  changes  in  market  risk  from  the  information  provided  under  Part  II,  Item  7A  (Quantitative  and\nQualitative Disclosures about Market Risk) of CSX's most recent annual report on Form 10-K except as provided below.\nChanges in interest rates may impact the cost of future interest payments on long-term debt issued by the Company, and as a\nresult, represent interest rate risk to the Company. In an effort to manage this risk, CSX may use certain financial instruments such as\nfixed-to-floating interest rate swaps. The following information, together with information included in Note 7, Debt and Credit Agreements,\ndescribes the key aspects of such contracts and the related market risk to CSX.\nIn first quarter 2022, CSX entered into five separate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps classified as fair value hedges. The swaps\nare designed to hedge 10 years of interest rate risk associated with market fluctuations attributable to the Secured Overnight Financing\nRate on a cumulative $800 million of fixed rate outstanding notes which are due between 2036 and 2040. As of June 30, 2022, the fair\nvalue of these swaps was a $72 million liability, which is included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The\nassociated cumulative adjustment to the hedged notes is included in long-term debt. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value\nof the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt so no gain or loss has been\nrecognized due to hedge ineffectiveness. Differences on the fixed-to-floating legs of the derivatives are recognized in interest expense and\nwere not material in second quarter or six months ended 2022. The swaps will expire in 2032. If settled early, the remaining liability or\nasset will be amortized over the remaining life of the associated notes.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nAs of June 30, 2022, under the supervision and with the participation of CSX's Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial\nOfficer (“CFO”), management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and\nprocedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that, as of June 30, 2022, the Company's disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in CSX's\nperiodic SEC reports. There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the second quarter of 2022\nthat have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nCSX Q2 2022 Form 10-Q p.45","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/7c62d325-406a-4369-8797-f6095c7f0fa4.pdf","pdf_numpages":52,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1671,"to":1697}}}}],["741bd8bb-ff14-4185-83d4-a913d544c345",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

And I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Korn, Head of\nInvestor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMatthew Korn\nThank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter call. Joining me this afternoon\nare Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of\nOperations; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; and Sean Pelkey, Executive\nVice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nIn the presentation accompanying this call, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2 followed\nby our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3.\nAnd with that, it's my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Joe Hinrichs.\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\nPresident, CEO & Director\nAll right. Good evening, everyone. Thank you, Matthew, and thank you all for joining our conference call.\nWorking together, the ONE CSX team delivered a strong first quarter, driven by solid pricing as well as\nvolume growth in our merchandise and coal businesses. With sufficient resources in place, we are able to\nuse the benefits of our scaled railroad model to deliver improvement in our customer service performance\nthat are driving real tangible financial results. Our network is running well, and we intend to do even\nbetter and show that CSX can sustain reliable service over time, which is essential for us to profitably\ngrow our railroad. 2023 has already proven to be a very active year. One of our top priorities after the\nnational union agreements were finalized last December was to address the matter of Paid sick leave for\nour union employees. I am very pleased that CSX demonstrated important leadership here. Starting in\nFebruary, we were the first U.S. class\n[Audio Gap]\nMore details about the specific proactive steps we have been taking to make CSX safer. I have also been\nactively involved in discussions with our leaders in Washington and the across states our network about\nsome of the legislation that has recently been proposed. They know that it's better for our economy, our\nenvironment and our communities for railroads to move a greater share of the nation's freight.\nThey also know that CSX is eager to be part of solutions that are effective, data-driven and will make\nour whole industry safer. We do not want safety performance to be a competitive advantage for CSX, but\nwanting to be something our entire industry is proud of. We have been encouraged by our conversations\nwith senior policy leaders and we'll continue to engage with them in the months ahead, sharing best\npractices and building on our common ground.\nWe are confident that the industry will emerge in this period stronger, more aligned and better at sharing\nsafety best practices. Now let's turn to our presentation to review the highlights of the first quarter. We\nmoved nearly 1.5 million carloads in the first quarter and generate over $3.7 billion in revenue, which was\n9% higher than the previous year. Operating income increased 14% year-over-year to $1.46 billion, and\nour operating ratio was 60.5%, which includes the OR impact of the quality carrier destruction business,\nas we've discussed in the past.\nFinally, earnings per share increased 23% to $0.48. When I came to CSX last fall, we were very clear with\nour intention to build on this company's excellent operating model by strengthening our relationships with\nour employees and serving our customers better. It is still early but you will hear clear examples of how","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/CSX Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2023.pdf","pdf_numpages":18,"loc":{"lines":{"from":101,"to":148}}}}],["a623f47c-1cb9-47cd-a483-97f1a8c51b6d",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2023\nCopyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\n5\nwe are starting to achieve this as Kevin, Jamie and Sean talk about the details, what was a very strong\nquarter.\nNow let me turn it over to our team.\nJamie J. Boychuk\nExecutive Vice President of Operations\nThank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Every quarter, you hear us emphasize the importance of\nsafety on our network. This is a fundamental part of our culture and defines how we execute our operating\nplan. We didn't take shortcuts, we don't compromise, and we teach this mindset to every 1 of our new\nhires and continually reemphasize it to all of our employees.\nIn this slide, you will see some of the real proactive steps that we are taking to keep our network running\nsafely. In 2023, we are installing 53 additional hot box detectors across our network. These added\ndetectors will reduce the average spacing from 16.2 miles to 14.9 miles. At CSX, these detectors identify\nhigh-bearing temperatures, but also transmit real-time data for trend analysis. So we can not only tell\nwhen a bearing is hot and a train needs to stop, but we can also use the data to predict bearings and\nissues before they reach critical temperatures. We're also continuing to integrate newly hired employees\ninto our safety culture, which begins on day 1. Newly hired employees attend extensive training at our\nrailroad Education and Development Institute in Atlanta.\nThe robust classroom, combined with field-based training gives these new employees the tools they need\nto operate safely in their new roles. Autonomous track assessment cars, commonly called ATACs, are also\nused as part of our proactive safety plan. These look and run like regular box cars that are loaded with\nadvanced technology. These cars operate on our regular trains and gather critical inspection data that\nallow us to closely monitor track conditions. Lastly, we are committed to being supportive partners in the\ncommunities in which we live and operate.\nThat is why we dedicate so much effort to developing relationships with first responders in those\ncommunities and teaching them how to properly respond to incidents, especially those with hazmat\nmaterials. We have a dedicated fleet of railcars, including 4 tank cars that are specifically designed and\nused to offer multi-day training sessions. This is a program we have run for many years. And in 2022, we\ntrained nearly 4,000 first responders. Turning to the next slide. The FRA personal injury rate ticked down\nsequentially, while the FRA train accident rate increased slightly. However, both measures are up year-\nover-year.\nIt's important to consider that because of the success of our recent hiring efforts, we have a higher\npercentage of newer employees -- as they gain experience and learn from federal railroaders, we are\nconfident that the frequency of these incidents will decline. Now turning to Slide 9. Operating performance\nhas improved significantly. With the appropriate resources in place, we are doing what we do best,\neffectively executing our operating plan. The team's ability to deliver these operating results is a true\ntestament to the tough and hard work that we are doing as an operating team and a plan that shows no\nother than what we can do here at CSX.\nMost importantly, the dedication that's given by all of our railroaders. I cannot thank our operating\nemployees enough for overcoming the resource challenges and delivering such solid performance for\nour customers. Carload trip performance of 86% reached an all-time record level this quarter. while\nintermodal trip plan performance of 96% matched a record high, while the team is pleased with these\nresults, we'll keep improving. In fact, both measures have continued to improve sequentially into the\nsecond quarter. I'm happy with the compliments and support we have received from customers regulators","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/CSX Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2023.pdf","pdf_numpages":18,"loc":{"lines":{"from":150,"to":196}}}}],["d6912a51-5274-4fa8-ade8-522dd784f60d",{"pageContent":"second quarter.

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\n6\nThank you, Jamie. We are very pleased with our merchandise performance this quarter. Revenue increased\n13%, benefiting from an 8% increase in revenue per unit and a 4% increase in volume. We are seeing\nsome encouraging signs as customers start to respond to our improved service and reduced cycle\ntimes. The team is focused on combining best-in-class service with creative solutions to identify new\ngrowth opportunities and gain wallet share with existing customers. While we did see positive growth in\nautomotive, customer production issues impacted volumes in the quarter.\nOn the positive side, we see production issues moderating and expect a strong outlook for automotive\nvolumes through the remainder of the year. Minerals and Metals both outperformed, driven largely by very\nstrong aggregates in steel demand. Pricing was up year-over-year as we benefited from favorable contract\nrepricing and higher fuel surcharge. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to see benefits from a\nsupportive pricing environment and improved rail service. While the economic outlook remains uncertain,\nwe continue to see positive momentum in many of our merchandise segments as the team focuses on the\ngrowth drivers that we can control.\nIt's still early but we are encouraged by our ability to convert improved service into new business wins in\nsegments such as auto, minerals and food products. There remains a significant opportunity to win share\nfrom truck across our merchandise portfolio. Turning to Slide 12. First quarter coal revenue increased 19%\non 19% higher volume and flat revenue per unit. Export volumes were strong as we leverage improved\ncycle times and improved production and performance at the origin mines. We also benefited as we lap the\neffects of reduced capacity at our Curtis Bay terminal.\nOur domestic shipments also improved on utility restocking demand and improved rail capacity.\nInternational met coal benchmarks remained strong over the quarter and now sits just below $300 per\nmetric ton, which continues to support strong production levels. Looking ahead, the international coal\nmarket continues to be supported by healthy commodity prices that should drive positive year-over-\nyear volume growth through the remainder of the year. While the domestic market could face a more\nchallenging backdrop should natural gas prices remain low.\nTurning to intermodal on Slide 13. First quarter revenue decreased by 5% as a 9% decrease in volume\nmore than offset a 5% increase in revenue per unit. Most of this volume decline was due to weakness\nin international intermodal markets, which, as we expected, have been heavily affected by slowing\nimport activity as demand softened and retail inventories remained elevated. Looking forward, while the\nintermodal market currently remains challenged, we do expect second half year-over-year headwinds\nto moderate. The team has a number of initiatives underway to continue to drive truck conversion by\nintroducing new lanes of service where there is market demand.\nNow finally, turning to Slide 14. Many of you are aware of the major market shift developing over the last\nfew years as more companies look to diversify their supply chain and bring capacity closer to their key\nend markets. We have been encouraged by the acceleration in activity with manufacturers of all times,\nannouncing plans and committing capital to build capacity in the Eastern U.S.\nFor CSX, this represents a great opportunity. Our network connects the major population centers of the\nNortheast with the fast-growing areas of the Southeast that are highly attractive for companies looking to\nexpand. The mission of our industrial development team is to partner with these companies and provide\nthem with a rail serve location where they can leverage the benefits of the CSX network and industry-","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/CSX Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2023.pdf","pdf_numpages":18,"loc":{"lines":{"from":203,"to":246}}}}],["35e81686-f50e-460f-91fb-1e03200fec51",{"pageContent":"them with a rail serve location where they can leverage the benefits of the CSX network and industry-\nleading service. We continue to invest in our select site program that has expanded to include a wider\nrange of rail serve site opportunities.\nCombined with new technology enhancements, this will allow us to capture industrial projects of all sizes\nby offering shovel-ready development sites with access to CSX network. As you can see on the slide, we\nare excited about the success we are seeing.

I would like to thank the entire team for all of their efforts across our\ngrowth initiatives. We're very excited about the momentum we are building and the engagement as we\npartner with our customers to grow together. Now I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss the financials.\nSean R. Pelkey\nExecutive VP & CFO\nThank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. Looking at the first quarter results, revenue increased 9% or\n$300 million on merchandise and coal volume growth, strong pricing and higher fuel recovery. Operating\nincome was up 14% to $1.5 billion as top line growth outpaced several expense headwinds, which I'll\ndiscuss in more detail on the following slide. Interest and other expense was $7 million higher compared\nto the prior year and income tax expense increased by $47 million on higher pretax earnings. Net earnings\nincreased 15% to $1 billion, while EPS grew 23%. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look\nat expenses.\nTotal first quarter expense increased $111 million compared to the prior year. This includes about $65\nmillion of inflation headwinds as well as an $85 million impact from higher fuel and depreciation combined\nwith lower real estate gains. Now turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe expense increased\n$31 million as the impacts of additional head count and inflation were partially offset by lower incentive\ncompensation expense. PS&O expense increased $13 million primarily due to inflation, the inclusion of Pan\nAm operations and scheduled locomotive overhauls.\nThese impacts were partially offset by a $46 million benefit due to an insurance recovery arising from a\ncustomer facility outage several years ago as well as lower intermodal costs as congestion eases. There\nwere also several smaller line item impacts within PS&O that were greater than expected this quarter and\nshould improve sequentially. Depreciation was up $33 million as a result of last year's equipment study\nas well as a larger asset base. And fuel expense also increased by $33 million due to a higher gallon price\nand a 3% increase in gross ton miles.\nEquipment and rents improved by $18 million, benefiting from increased fluidity and faster car higher days\nper load across all markets. Property gains were $19 million unfavorable in the quarter due primarily to\nlapping prior year gains from the Virginia real estate transaction. Network and congestion related savings\nwere evident within rents and across intermodal terminal expenses this quarter, and we expect sustained\nnetwork performance to drive further efficiency savings through the year.\nNow turning to cash flow on Slide 18. CSX generated over $800 million of free cash flow in the quarter.\nreflecting the impact of cash payments for retroactive wages and bonuses paid to union employees.\nAdding back these payments, free cash flow would have been up slightly versus last year despite higher\ninvestments in the business. You'll also recall that CSX has introduced a measure of economic profit\ncalled CSX Cash earnings, or CCE, within our long-term incentive compensation. It benefits both our\nshareholders and the general public when we grow profitably by encouraging the conversion of freight off\nthe highway.\nAnd CCE is aligned with this shared interest by encouraging disciplined high-return capital investments.\nThe calculation can be seen in the appendix. And through Q1, CCE is up $165 million versus the prior\nyear.

Hinrichs\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThank you. Thank you, Sean. Now let's conclude with some comments on our outlook for 2023, as shown\non Slide 20. First, as you heard Kevin describe, we are very pleased with the performance we have seen\nyear-to-date from our merchandise business. Strong demand for grains, metals, Minerals and Automotive,","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/CSX Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2023.pdf","pdf_numpages":18,"loc":{"lines":{"from":301,"to":309}}}}],["5b38b7ff-834c-4e5d-b754-57aaa81be6c3",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2023\nCopyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

We're also off to a strong start to the year for coal, and\nwe expect continued benefit from healthy export demand, both thermal and met. Our merchandise and\ncoal have met or exceeded our expectations. Intermodal volumes have been below what we anticipated.\nWe knew the intermodal -- sorry, we knew the international intermodal activity will be down substantially\nover the first half of the year. And though parts of our domestic business are doing very well, has not been\nenough to offset the effect of lower imports and elevated inventory.\nAltogether, Intermodal contributes less than 1/3 of our revenues, but it does contribute roughly half of our\nvolume and was a drag on our total volume over the quarter. The softer intermodal performance will make\nit difficult for our total CSX volume to meet our previous guidance and grow faster than GDP, especially\nas consensus GDP estimates for 2023 have moved up and are currently at 1.1%. That said, the effect on\nour business mix is favorable. Revenue ton miles grew by a solid 4% in the first quarter, driven by the\nstrength in merchandise and export coal and we expect revenue ton miles to grow solidly in the low single\ndigits for the full year. The rest of our outlook is consistent with what we told you at the beginning of the\nyear.\nWe continue to benefit from the favorable pricing environment with customer negotiations supported by\nour transparency on costs and our improved service products. We still expect supplemental revenues\nto decline by roughly $300 million compared to last year, with much of that decline in run rate already\nin [indiscernible] in the first quarter. International met coal benchmarks remained very strong over the\nquarter and spot prices are just below $300 per tonne today, but year-over-year comparisons will get\ntougher from here. We will continue our efforts to drive higher efficiency and reduce excess costs to\ncounter the inflationary effects in our labor and other operating costs as best we can. So -- the best way\nfor us to support our margin performance will be to drive more merchandise volume and benefit from the\npowerful operating leverage potential of our network.\nLastly, we still estimate cash flow expenditures at $2.3 billion. In closing, I am very encouraged by what\nwe accomplished in this quarter. I'm energized to see the ONE CSX culture start to take shape across this\ncompany. Every industry has challenges, but ours are addressable and solvable, and I am confident that\nthey are far outweighed by the opportunities that we have ahead. As I said before, all of us here at every\nlocation across our network share a common goal of providing the safe, reliable service to our customers\nthat drives profitable growth, and we are taking meaningful steps towards that goal. Thank you, and we'll\nnow take your questions.\nMatthew Korn\nThank you, Joe. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, operator, please open up the line for questions.","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/CSX Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2023.pdf","pdf_numpages":18,"loc":{"lines":{"from":311,"to":347}}}}],["7be00cad-0d68-436c-97f6-f07c0f8220de",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2023\nCopyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

Can you\njust talk about the order rates, the fill rates across the network? You've heard some different comments\nand clearly, intermodal is suffering from poor bid compliance. But where do you see when you talk to your\ncustomers across the different networks, I guess, primarily within merchandise, where it might be a little\nmore service and truck sensitive.\nKevin S. Boone\nExecutive VP and Chief of Sales & Marketing\nYes. I think you probably remember the discussion over the last few quarters where we said we weren't\nup against the order rates. I would say we're probably more in line with that, especially with our improved\nservice levels. So we're meeting the customer demand currently, but we did see weakness kind of starting\nlast year during the third quarter, fourth quarter period. So as we look through the back half of the year,\nin many of our markets, particularly on the merchandise side, we see -- we should see some easier\ncomparisons based on the current economic activity that we're seeing. So that's what gives us kind of the\nconfidence in the guidance as we move through the year.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKenneth Scott Hoexter\nBofA Securities, Research Division\nGreat. If I could just follow on that thought there, Kevin. So it seems like something changed economically\nkind of mid-February, right, if we look at spot rates in trucking. Can you talk about -- I don't know, Joe,\nyou seem to be talking about kind of intermodal being tougher, and that's why switching from a GDP\nplus to a kind of an RTM type of outlook. Is there something changing economically in the backdrop\nmore recently? Or is that just the weakness in the truck market? Maybe just talk a little bit about on the\nintermodal side or just the economic background.\nKevin S. Boone\nExecutive VP and Chief of Sales & Marketing\nYes, I think -- and we certainly expected a weak market on the international side, but it's safe to say\nthat I think that market came in a bit weaker than what we had expected in the first quarter. But on the\nflip side, and I would probably make this trade off every time as we saw some strength in some of the\nmerchandise markets that obviously have a much higher ARPU and revenue contribution. So -- that's kind\nof what we saw through the quarter. There are varying opinions on when the international market will\nrecover. Some of our larger customers expect some kind of pickup in the second half. We have seen some\nstability over the last 2 to 3 weeks, which is encouraging, but we'll face difficult comparisons through the\nthird quarter and then fourth quarter gets a lot easier.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.\nJonathan B. Chappell\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/CSX Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2023.pdf","pdf_numpages":18,"loc":{"lines":{"from":349,"to":395}}}}],["d20f5f4e-4a82-4eb3-ab8c-89fce81dca3e",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2023\nCopyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

Given the slides that Jamie put up, particularly #9, with all those\nservice improvements, Trip plan performance, et cetera, do you feel like you're being appropriately\ncompensated for your improved service, both on an absolute basis, but especially on a relative basis as\nyou go through these contract renewals. And I guess another way to ask that is, how far are you through\nthe contract renewals that actually exemplify some of the service improvements that you've done over the\nlast couple of months?\nKevin S. Boone\nExecutive VP and Chief of Sales & Marketing\nYes. Typically, when you look at our renewal rates, and we renew a little over half our business every year,\nand that's highly concentrated in the fourth and first quarters. And I would say, given the backdrop in\ninflation that we would certainly we're having those conversations with our customers to be able to cover\nour cost increases that are very visible to the market. As we continue to prove our service, customers\ncontinue to reiterate, they're willing to pay for the service and the reliability that we can provide. And\nthe plan is, and we -- I think that's starting to occur as we believe we have a differentiated service in the\nmarket.\nAnd so it's -- we're starting to see early success in our conversations with customers around more volume\nopportunities with them. And I can't reiterate enough in a market like this is where we should be taking\nshare. Our customers are looking for ways to save money. Usually, rail is a cheaper option for them, and\nthey're getting more and more confidence in our ability to deliver the service that we need to. So the team\nis very, very excited about some of the things that we've been able to do here over the last few months.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Robert Oglenski\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\nAnd maybe this is for Joe or Jamie, but we've had, obviously, a lot of negative press on the railroads,\nunfortunately, in the last few months. And the PSR concept has kind of been dragged through the mud a\nbit. But can you guys compare and contrast because you are delivering just like the last question, very\ngood service metrics here. So what's driving the difference between the rest of the industry? And I guess,\nhow do you leverage that going forward. .\nJoseph R. Hinrichs\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes, thanks. I'll start and let Jamie add some comments. As I've said many times in the past, I think\nthe guiding principles of our operating model are long-standing and are sustainable, and that, of course,\nimproves safety control costs. Improve asset utilization, improve the employee experience and then also\nimprove customer service, and we are working hard at all 5 of those and keeping them in balance as far\nas how we prioritize for always safety first.\nAnd I believe very strongly that the results that we're seeing throughout our network and being delivered\nby our great ONE CSX team is a result of that and focusing on our employees and the customer service\nspecifically. And so I believe that the principles of [indiscernible] railroading are just as valid today as they\nwere 5 years ago. Obviously, it's how you keep things in balance and how you prioritize and how you bring\neveryone along and we're trying to lead by example in that regard.\nJamie J. Boychuk\nExecutive Vice President of Operations\nWell, Joe hit it really well. For -- when I think about -- and I hear people say PSR, what does that really\nmean? I don't know. I only know one way to railroad. And this is the way I was taught the railroad many\nyears ago back when I was at CN. So we've been able to teach the great folks at CSX over the past\n6 years how to do this. I've got an unbelievable operating team, some great bench strength and we","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/CSX Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2023.pdf","pdf_numpages":18,"loc":{"lines":{"from":397,"to":447}}}}],["ed923ef4-151f-45ce-9e9a-fca1dd64d281",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2023\nCopyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\n11\nare doing fantastic, and we've got the resources in place in order to now actually operate the plan. We\nstruggled for years to do that through COVID, but we've come out of it the way we said we would.\nAnd we're operating the plant and the team that's out there that's exercising that in the field, not just\nthe network folks who put the plan together, but the field team who is executing it and the folks on the\n[indiscernible] line who are running the trains each and every day that are doing an unbelievable job\nare getting the trains from point A to Z the way we need them to and servicing the customers the way\nthat we've committed to servicing them and giving Kevin and his team a product that gives them an\nopportunity to finally go out there and sell something that's different. So I don't know, call it what you\nwant. I just call it railroading.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott H. Group\nWolfe Research, LLC\nKevin, how should we be thinking about rev per carload in sequentially even from 1Q, 2Q. Just maybe\nwalk us through some of the puts and takes. And then similar things, Sean, just 60.5% OR in Q1. I know\nthere's the insurance recovery, but do you think we see sequential improvement from here the rest of the\nyear.\nKevin S. Boone\nExecutive VP and Chief of Sales & Marketing\nYes. I think really the biggest driver from Q1 to Q2, we continue to, as I said, see strong pricing in the\nbackdrop of higher inflation and that's not going to -- that's going to continue throughout the year as we\nobviously have contract renewals, and we'll have those discussions with customers.\nThe biggest swing factor, quite frankly, is fuel surcharge and where you see diesel prices head into the\nsummer here. And on a year-over-year basis, where they sit right now, obviously, that's an optical\nheadwind, but we know how quickly those can recover, and so we'll see where that trends. But other than\nthat, you look at export coal and sequentially, probably ex fuel, you're probably looking at something\nthat's flat to the first quarter on the coal RPU, which can swing around a little bit, and that's one that you\nusually ask about. But otherwise, positive momentum on the core price and then we'll just have to wait\nand see where the diesel prices shake out.\nSean R. Pelkey\nExecutive VP & CFO\nAnd then, Scott, in terms of operating ratio, yes, I mean, 60.5% for the first quarter is obviously a great\nstart for us. I think as you think about sequentially, you probably have to normalize that for both the\ninsurance gain and then the favorable fuel lag benefit that we had in the quarter. So that gets you to\naround a 62.5%. We almost always do better in the second quarter from an OR perspective than the first,\nand that's primarily as a result of the fact that volumes typically seasonally increase in Q2 relative to Q1.\nWe don't see any reason to believe that we'll see anything different this year.\nParticularly with some of the issues we had in Q1 with auto production that should ease here, have eased\nand a strong demand for aggregate. So it's a good setup. I will say just one thing to caveat that with\nis other revenue was a little bit elevated in Q1 versus the run rate where it likely will be the rest of the\nyear, that may be a little bit of a headwind, but on the flip side, we feel good about the cost momentum if\nservice continues to be at these levels or even better, we should see more costs come out sequentially.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Fadi Chamoun with BMO.\nFadi Chamoun\nBMO Capital Markets Equity Research","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/CSX Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2023.pdf","pdf_numpages":18,"loc":{"lines":{"from":449,"to":498}}}}],["a1c64127-546b-488a-bb1f-c1d6fd0792ee",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2023\nCopyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

You had the slide talking about the 19 new facilities coming online and obviously, a very strong\npipeline that you've discussed in the past into '24 and '25. But I'm just curious when you talk to existing\ncustomers, your existing facilities, are you seeing growth in your share of wallet? If you could give us\nsome examples, some tangible example to kind of appreciate that.\nKevin S. Boone\nExecutive VP and Chief of Sales & Marketing\nYes, Fadi. I think that's directly tied to our service product. And we're in the very early innings of that. I\nthink we've seen some customers more willing to have those conversations and others that are kind of\nwait and see and want to see more months or even quarters of good performance before they're willing\nto have that conversation. But we've seen some early success. One example that comes to mind is in our\nfood products category where we've gone from roughly a 60% share with our customer now 90% share\nand doing some things operationally, thanks to Jamie and his team have provided a really, really good\nservice to them, truck-like service that really benefits them from a cost perspective. And that's a direct\ntruck conversion for us. But I see many, many more of those examples starting to happen.\nWe're working really diligently with Jamie's team and having [indiscernible] exercises with our customers.\nwhich is really thinking through the art of what's possible, putting our network against what their needs\nare and really figuring out if there's opportunities to grow and how we really convert the truck. I think the\ncustomer acceptance on these meetings has been the highest I've ever seen because they're looking for\nways to save on costs given the uncertain backdrop on the market. But a lot of momentum -- the team is\nworking really hard. We have a number of these set up over the next few weeks and quarters ahead. And\nI expect to have a lot of success.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nMichael Triano\nThis is Mike Triano on for Tom. So Trip plan compliance and carload 86 seems to be a level where you can\nmake some good progress on truck conversions. Do you think that there are enough crew resources on\nthe network to maintain a strong service product? Or is there some additional hiring that you have to do\nfrom here?\nJamie J. Boychuk\nExecutive Vice President of Operations\nMike, we've got a good number with respect to our people. We're still working on a -- like to get another\n150 to 200 folks as we try to get closer to a 7,400 number, in particular, for vacation peak. We're sitting\naround 70% to 80%, I think, today, close to 73%. So we want to push towards that. Now remember,\nattrition is 10%. We've got to continue to stay up against attrition, which also gives us another trigger if\nsomething goes the other way, where we could react, as Sean mentioned, with some costs along the way\nif we needed to. Resource-wise, we definitely have enough locomotives out there. As a matter of fact, the\nfaster we get the more fluid we get, we need less locomotives.\nSo we'll continue to analyze those resources and pull them out where we need to, but keep them in a spot\nwhere we can use them as Kevin and his team brings more business on we're able to bring them back.\nAnd of course, everything that comes back earns its keep. So we'll continue to work those resources. But\non the car side, that's a strategy we continue to look at as a team. working with customers. I know Kevin\nand his team and my team are working close to make sure we've got car supply as we need them as we\nwork with customers and make sure that we have the right resources on that end. At this point in time, we\nfeel good with where we are.\nBut you see the growth that's coming, and Kevin talked about some of those growth areas that are","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/CSX Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2023.pdf","pdf_numpages":18,"loc":{"lines":{"from":500,"to":548}}}}],["e4460bde-f825-4319-83b3-d8e6bcdcc05f",{"pageContent":"feel good with where we are.\nBut you see the growth that's coming, and Kevin talked about some of those growth areas that are\nout there.

And I'm very encouraged of we have a plan to make sure that we can meet the coming demand in\nsome of these markets that we see great growth and whether it's aggregates some of the auto business,\nwhere we know that car supply is going to be a differentiating factor where we feel like we have a good\nplan in place.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Trennon Long\nStephens Inc., Research Division\nSean, I think on prior calls, you talked about the elevated level of service-related costs that should\nmoderate this year. During the call in January, I felt like you were suggesting this tailwind would be more\nsecond half weighted. But could you share any updated thoughts on the cadence of these cost savings?\nI'm curious if you saw this materialize in the first quarter and how you're expecting that number to trend\nin the quarters ahead?\nSean R. Pelkey\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes. I think we're off to a good start. Like I said, we had about $15 million to $20 million of what I would\ncall congestion related cost savings in the quarter. That was mostly -- you see that clearly on the rents line\non a within PS&O related to intermodal terminals. So we are already seeing some of those costs come out,\nas I mentioned, sequentially into Q2. Our forecast is that we'll see that pick up a little bit. And then as we\nget to the second half, that's where we'll see the bulk of it, like you mentioned.\nSo -- and that's going to be in -- continue to be improvements in things like rents and intermodal\nterminals, locomotive maintenance related to the engine count that Jamie talked about, over time and\nother related crew costs. So -- and then on top of that, we've got other initiatives not just related to\ncycling some of the congestion issues from last year that we're working on. And of course, volume growth\nalways helps in terms of productivity levels, both our crews and our assets.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.\nChristian F. Wetherbee\nCitigroup Inc., Research Division\nMaybe a question on the headcount side. Jamie, you gave some good near-term color. I guess I'm curious\nin the context of sort of your progress towards that 7,400 goal. And then reflecting the fact that the\nvolume environment is maybe a little bit more questionable than it was earlier in the year. Is there a point\nwhere maybe you hit the pause button on hire and kind of reassess the volume environment? And so after\nthe second quarter, we could see that number potentially moderate depending on the economic conditions\nwe're seeing.\nJamie J. Boychuk\nExecutive Vice President of Operations\nChris. No, I'm -- listen, we -- I wouldn't say we took the pause button at all. What we've done is this time,\nI'd say, last quarter when we were talking, we had 550 trainees out there. We're looking to keep ourselves\naround 350 to 400 trainees as we move forward on a constant basis. So we dropped that number a bit\nknowing that we don't need to ramp up the way we were. As I said, we look at 10% as our attrition rate.\nSo we still need to ramp up that number a little bit. And then, of course, we'll review a little bit if we need\nto bring that down to maybe 300 or maybe that 350 is the sweet spot.","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/CSX Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2023.pdf","pdf_numpages":18,"loc":{"lines":{"from":554,"to":603}}}}],["b57fa38c-4ec0-40be-9bb0-5433c794cb67",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2023\nCopyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

But of course, we're working really hard with our initiatives to see what we can do to get\npeople to stay at the railroad. And if we see those numbers come down, then we'd be looking at our hiring\nneeds obviously drop with that. But we're in a good spot. We're at a much better spot than where we\nwere in the past with those numbers. I feel comfortable. And that's on the T&E side. Of course, we are still\ndoing locomotive engineer training as we move forward.\nIt's the right thing for us to do, so we don't get ourselves in a situation where we're short on engineers\nin the future, but we recycle conductors to make engineers. And we're always hiring on our engineering\nside of the house and mechanical side as we continue to look at that high end on the union side. So\nour numbers are at a pretty good point. I don't see any large jumps at all. If anything, it's more just\nmaintaining where we're at. And if we need to look at if things really go in a different direction. We know\nthat we've got that 10% attrition rate. We've committed to our T&E folks that we're going to keep them\n[indiscernible] employed as long as we can through whatever we need to weather any storms. We don't\nnecessarily see any storms ahead of us, but we don't know what the markets show obviously. But if we\nneed to, we can pull that trigger on hiring really quick.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Singh Mehrotra\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nCongrats on the results really impressive. One question I wanted to ask. So if I look at intermodal\nrevenue as a percentage of the total enterprise, it was like 13.5%, which I mean I could be wrong, but\nI think that's the lowest number at least this decade over the last 10 years. And so I guess I'm trying to\nunderstand, you showed good cost leverage the mix was really positive in terms of where that -- where\nthe revenue growth came from. And so I guess I'm just trying to understand what happens to cost ex fuel\nas some of the intermodal mix normalize as a percentage of revenue. I don't know if you think that's a\nfair question or not, but it just seems like maybe that has something to do with some of the strong cost\nleverage.\nSean R. Pelkey\nExecutive VP & CFO\nYes. I mean, Amit, we don't get into sort of specific margins within each line of business. To the extent\nthat intermodal volumes were down, which, of course, they were. You're going to see savings at\nintermodal terminals. We'll be able to see some savings on our crew starts. We'll have some savings on\nfuel -- but did that disproportionately impact our margins this year? And would that disproportionately\nimpact them if intermodal or I should say, when intermodal recovers I don't think that's our view. We've\ngot strong incremental margins within every segment of the business. And I think as intermodal -- as\nthose volumes normalize and begin to grow again, it's going to have a positive impact on our operating\nratio.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse.\nAriel Luis Rosa\nCrédit Suisse AG, Research Division\nCongrats on a strong quarter here. Kevin, you laid out a pretty exciting pipeline of new business\nopportunities there. I was hoping you could maybe quantify the impact of that in terms of revenue\nor earnings and kind of what the time line might look like for realizing whether it's that 500 set of\nopportunities that you talked about, what that might look like over the next couple of years.\nKevin S.

I mean when you look at a number of these projects, it's going to take a couple of years, if not 3\nyears, to really complete some of the auto facilities that we're seeing, some of the -- on the metal side\nas well. So really, I think the momentum builds into 2025. aspirationally, if you ask me, it's kind of 1 to 2\npoints of growth that we would aspire to on a gross basis.

Or how should we think about where the competition lies for that\ngrowth?\nKevin S. Boone\nExecutive VP and Chief of Sales & Marketing\nWell, as you know, over the last 40, 50 years, the railroads haven't done a great job of attracting new\nindustrial development to the railroad. So it's all about getting the word out. It's all getting investing in our\nteam, making sure that companies understand the advantages particularly some of these new markets,\nwhen you think about battery production that is very, very new to the United States, and they need to\n-- they're not familiar with necessarily rail infrastructure and what we can offer. So A lot of the exciting\nemerging markets, that's where you have to be out in front of it and make sure that you have -- you offer\nthe locations, the infrastructure, the energy resources that they need in order to move quickly.\nAnd it's all about having shovel-ready opportunities that touch the railroad, which you can develop\nquickly. And the market is moving way quicker than it ever has. And so that's why it's key to have these\nindustrial sites ready for those customers to go. We compete every day with our eastern peer as well.\nAnd certainly, we're learning -- leaning into the service that we can provide. We touch a lot of other good\nindustrial companies that they want to reach. And so those all things are factors in our selling points to the\ncustomers as they make these decisions.\nOperator\nTake our next question from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nUnknown Analyst\nThis is Andre filling in for Jordan. I just wanted to sort of follow up on the fuel piece. It looks like fuel\nsurcharge revenue was up $121 million year-over-year, but fuel expense was only up $33 million. So the\nnet of the 2 is an $88 million benefit to EBIT in the first quarter. I think that benefit was more like $63\nmillion in the fourth quarter. So some acceleration here on the fuel benefit. Any expectation for, I guess,\nhow that trends in terms of timing or magnitude, It just -- or it seems like based on the diesel strips, you\nmight see some benefit in the second quarter still and maybe drop in the third quarter. You just sort of\ncurious in your thoughts here and what offsets there might be.\nSean R. Pelkey\nExecutive VP & CFO\nThanks, Andre. This is Sean. Your math is correct. I think if you look into the second quarter and you're\nlooking on a sequential basis, at least where fuel prices are and where the forward curve is, it will be a net\ndrag. I would put it in the category of $50 million plus versus the first quarter on a net basis. That's the\nimpact to both revenue and expense.

So we'll be cycling\nthat, assuming no change to diesel prices versus where they are right now.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Scott Vernon\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nSean, can you talk a little bit about expectations for average cost per hedge kind of on a year-over-year\nbasis and add any color to how much the CTO that's been added into the benefit packages is impacting\ncost for full year '23?\nSean R. Pelkey\nExecutive VP & CFO\nAbsolutely, David. So on cost per employee, I think we came in right about where we expected. Maybe\na little bit favorable just due to mix impact of employees with the driver count at quality, which are a\nlittle less in terms of dollars per employee -- as you go to Q2, I think it will be fairly stable versus Q1,\nmaybe up a little bit depending on that employee mix. And then as we get into the second half of the\nyear, you will see a step-up just due to the timing of the wage increases for the union employees, which is\nscheduled to be a 4% increase -- in terms of the cost of the [Sick leave], which we've now got agreements\nwith about 10,000 of our union employees -- we are -- we have added those costs into the forecast.\nThe experience so far has been very positive. We are seeing the employees take advantage of the benefit,\nand we are seeing when that's needed. There's a little bit of additional overtime, but there are some\nbenefits to it as well and certainly quality of life is 1 of those benefits. And on a net basis, I would say, a\ncouple of million a quarter at this point.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Ann Marie Poliniak-Cusic\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\nJust going back to the share gain piece of it. Merchandise volume, you grew 4%. Is there any way to\nquantify or give us some perspective of what those share gains were this quarter, if any? And as we think\nabout that spread over what the market is growing in those areas, is that 1% to 2% on top of that a\npretty good guide. And would that be more of '24 for this? Or do you think you can get there in '23?\nKevin S. Boone\nExecutive VP and Chief of Sales & Marketing\nYes. I think a lot of the success that we had in -- particularly on the merchandise side is really the service\nimprovement that we saw. And our ability to capture the orders that our customers have. And so that\nJanuary, February were really good months, weather probably was a little bit favorable in those months\nas well that then certainly help us, but then Jamie would tell me, March was pretty challenging from a\nweather perspective. So I would say overall, normal weather through the quarter, probably a little better\nin January, February. But it really is about just a service recovery and our ability on a year-over-year basis\nto capture more of the demand that was out there even though we've seen a little bit of softness in some\nmarkets.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital.\nWalter Noel Spracklin\nRBC Capital Markets, Research Division","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/CSX Corporation, Q1 2023 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2023.pdf","pdf_numpages":18,"loc":{"lines":{"from":709,"to":756}}}}],["c83eb1fd-1bdf-4e76-b224-7472bdb93452",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL |  APR 20, 2023\nCopyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence\n17\nSo I want to turn it back to Sean for a moment here. And really just related back to Jamie and Joe's\ncomments. I mean -- and even Kevin. So Jamie has a pretty good handle on operations here. The model\nis working very well. Kevin is translating it into business wins and good growth opportunities. And then\nJoe in his outlook mentioned that asset productivity is going to exceed or approach prior record levels.\nwhen I go back and look at prior record levels, that's the time when you were hitting kind of the low 58\nOR. Is that a good -- I mean is that overly simplistic to say that when you're hitting those kind of record\noperating record asset productivity levels that you can't achieve those type of ORs in 2023? Or is it a little\ntoo simplistic, Sean, to look at it that way?\nSean R. Pelkey\nExecutive VP & CFO\nWell, Walter, I think you think back to the 58 OR, the first thing you've got to recognize is the quality\nacquisitions since then. So that's about 250 basis points of headwind. And we've had a lot of inflation.\nWe're paying employees more. The underlying cost of contractors and materials is higher. And so those\nare headwinds. That being said, as we continue to run the business well and we deliver good productivity,\nand we get great feedback from the customers. We've got this pipeline of wins that are setting up as\nwell as delivering against customer expectations and demands. We're going to deliver that at strong\nincremental margins, and that's going to help out over the medium to long term on the OR. I can't give\nyou a specific point destination. But as we go forward, we would expect improvement from where we are\nright now.\nOperator\nWe'll take our next question from Jason Seidl with Cowen.\nJason H. Seidl\nTD Cowen, Research Division\nCongrats on the good quarter. It's really nice to see the service doing so well here, and that was reflected,\nI think, in our survey that we did this quarter. I wanted to talk about your outlook and sort of what's\nbaked in with an assumption on the West Coast ports sort of coming to a labor agreement. Are you\nlooking for some of that East Coast volumes to shift back? And if so, how do you think it will affect\noperations?\nKevin S. Boone\nExecutive VP and Chief of Sales & Marketing\nFrom that perspective, I don't see a huge amount of shift. You're going to continue to see you a secular\nadvantage of the East Coast, and there's a lot of investment going on, as you know, in Savannah and\nother ports on the network. Quite frankly, the challenges on the West Coast have heard our intermodal\nbusiness, when you think of what wants to come across through California through Chicago onto our\nnetwork. So I view that as probably an incremental positive for us that some of that freight will see\nthrough the interchange with some of our Western partners out there. So that's a positive outcome in my\nmind in terms of our growth opportunity as we move into the back half.\nOperator\nThank you. And this does conclude today's presentation.

Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies\nBackground\nCSX Corporation together with its subsidiaries (\"CSX\" or the “Company”), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the\nnation's leading transportation companies. The Company provides rail-based transportation services including traditional rail\nservice,   the   transport   of   intermodal   containers   and   trailers,   as   well   as   other   transportation   services   such   as   rail-to-truck\ntransfers and bulk commodity operations.\nCSX's   principal   operatin  g   subsidiary,   CSX   Transportation,   Inc.   (“CSXT”),   provides   an   important   link   to   the\ntransportation supply chain through its approximately 20,000 route mile rail network and serves major population centers in\n26 states east of the Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The\nCompany's intermodal business links customers to railroads via trucks and terminals. On June 1, 2022, CSX completed its\nacquisition of Pan Am Systems, Inc. (“Pan Am”), which is the parent compan y of Pan Am Railways, Inc. This acquisition\nexpanded CSXT’s reach in the Northeastern United States. CSXT is also responsible for the Company's real estate sales,\nleasing, acquisition and management and development activities, substantially all of which are focused on supporting railroad\noperations.\nOther entities\nIn addition to CSXT, the Company’s subsidiaries include Quality Carriers, Inc. (\"Quality Carriers\"), CSX Intermodal\nTerminals,   Inc.   (“CSX   Intermodal   Terminals”),   Total   Distribution   Services,   Inc.   (“TDSI”),   Transflo   Terminal   Services,   Inc.\n(“Transflo”), CSX Technology, Inc. (“CSX Technology”) and other subsidiaries. Quality Carriers is the largest provider of bulk\nliquid chemicals truck transportation in North America. CSX Intermodal Terminals owns and operates a system of intermodal\nterminals,   predominantly   in   the   eastern   United   States   and   also   performs   drayage   services   (the   pickup   and   delivery   of\nintermodal   shipments)   for   certain   customers.   TDSI   serves   the   automotive   industry   with   distribution   centers   and   storage\nlocations. Transflo connects non-rail served customers to the many benefits of rail by transferring products from rail to trucks.\nThe   biggest   Transflo   markets   are   chemicals   and   agriculture,   which   includes   shipments   of   plastics   and   ethanol.   CSX\nTechnology and other subsidiaries provide support services for the Company.\nSale of Property Rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three\nCSX-owned line segments to the Commonwealth of Virginia (“Commonwealth”) over three phases. The timing and amount of\ngains recognized were based on the allocation of fair value to each conveyance, the timing of conveyances and collectability.\nOver the course of this transaction, which was completed in 2022, total proceeds of $ 525  million were collected and total\ngains of $ 493  million were recognized. A gain of $ 20  million was recognized in first quarter 2022 related to the closing of\nthe second phase.\nCSX Q1 2023 Form 10-Q p.7","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/CSX_Corporation_-_Form_10-Q(Apr-20-2023).pdf","pdf_numpages":71,"loc":{"lines":{"from":299,"to":334}}}}],["15d0e25e-5ece-46d4-b1d0-81b44ff425f0",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 1.

Where applicable,\nprior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Pursuant to the rules and regulations of\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), certain information and disclosures normally included in the notes to the\nannual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) have been\nomitted from these interim financial statements. CSX suggests that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the\naudited financial statements and the notes included in CSX's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently\nfiled current reports on Form 8-K.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company's fiscal periods are based upon the calendar year. Except as otherwise specified, references to “first\nquarter(s)” or “three months” indicate CSX's fiscal periods ending March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, and references to\n\"year-end\" indicate the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\")\n2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting . As the London Interbank Offered Rate\n(\"LIBOR\") will no longer be available beginning July 2023, this standard update provides practical expedients for contract\nmodifications made as part of the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon\nissuance and at present can generally be applied through December 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2023, the Company has not\napplied the practical expedient to any contracts.\nCSX Q1 2023 Form 10-Q p.8\n\nTable of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 2.

Payouts for certain executive officers are\nsubject to formulaic upward or downward adjustment by up to 25 %, capped at an overall payout of 250 %, based upon the\nCompany's total shareholder return relative to specified comparable groups over the performance period.

Considering the legal defenses currently available, the liabilities that have been recorded and other factors, it is the\nopinion of management that none of these items individually, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Should a number of these items occur in the same period,\nhowever, their combined effect could be material in that particular period.\nCasualty\nCasualty reserves of $ 193 million and $ 194 million as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively,\nrepresent   accruals   for   personal   injury,   occupational   disease   and   occupational   injury   claims   primarily   related   to   railroad\noperations. The Company's self-insured retention amount for casualty claims is $ 100  million per occurrence. Currently, no\nindividual claim is expected to exceed the self-insured retention amount.\nPersonal Injury\nPersonal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. Work-related injuries\nfor CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (“FELA”). CSXT retains an independent\nactuary to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims. An analysis is performed by the actuary qua\nrterly and is reviewed by management.

The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and\njudicial  proceedings  involving  private  parties  and  regulatory  agencies.  The  Company  has  been  identified  as  a  potentially\nresponsible party at approximately 240 environmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial\naction under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\"), also\nknown as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on\nproperties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these proceedings, however, are based on\nallegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for\ntreatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company's land holdings were leased to others for commercial or\nindustrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property\nand could give rise to proceedings against the Company.\nIn   any   such   proceedings,   the   Company   is   subject   to   environmental   clean-up   and   enforcement   actions   under   the\nSuperfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on\ncurrent and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs\ncould be substantial.\nThe Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least quarterly. Based on management's review\nprocess, amounts have been recorded to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation costs with respect to\neach site to the extent such costs are reasonably estimable and probable. Payments related to these liabilities are expected\nto be made over the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in purchased services and other on\nthe consolidated income statements.\nCurrently,  the  Company   does  not  possess  sufficient   information   to  reasonably  estimate  the  amounts  of   additional\nliabilities,  if  any,  on  some  sites  until  completion  of  future  environmental  studies.

Commitments and Contingencies\nInsurance\nThe Company maintains insurance programs with substantial limits for property damage, including resulting business\ninterruption, and third-party liability. A certain amount of risk is retained by the Company on each insurance program. Under\nits property insurance program, the Company retains all risk up to $ 100 million per occurrence for losses from floods and\nnamed   windstorms   and   up   to   $  75  million   per   occurrence   for   other   property   losses.   For   third-party   liability   claims,   the\nCompany   retains   all   risk   up   to   $  100  million   per   occurrence.   As   CSX   negot  iates   insurance   coverage   above   its   full\nself-retention amounts, it retains a percentage of risk at various layers of coverage. While the Company believes its insurance\ncoverage is adequate, future claims could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available\nat commercially reasonable rates.\nLegal\nThe Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims,\nvarious  governmental  proceedings  and  private  civil  lawsuits,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  those  related  to  fuel  surcharge\npractices, tax matters, environmental and hazardous material exposure matters, FELA and labor claims by current or former\nemployees, other personal injury or property claims and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and\ncharges. Some of the legal proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive damages and others are, or are\npurported  to  be,  class  actions.   While  the   final   outcome  of   these   matters  cannot   be   predicted   with   certainty,   considering,\namong other things, the legal defenses available and liabilities that have been recorded along with applicable insurance, it is\ncurrently the opinion of management that none of these pending items is likely to have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these\nitems, however, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity in\nthat particular period.\nThe Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss for certain legal proceedings for which a loss is reasonably\npossible in  excess  of  reserves  established.  The  Company  has  estimated this  range  to  b e  $ 3  million to  $  22 million in\naggregate at March 31, 2023. This estimated aggregate range is based upon currently available information and is subject to\nsignificant judgment and a variety of assumptions. Accordingly, the Company's estimate will change from time to time, and\nactual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate.\nFuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation\nIn May 2007, class action lawsuits were filed against CSXT and three oth er U.S.-based Class I railroads alleging that\nthe defendants' fuel surcharge practices relating to contract and unregulated traffic resulted from an illegal  conspiracy in\nviolation   of   antitrust   laws.   The   class   action   lawsuits   were   consolidated   into  one  case   in   federal   court   in   the   District   of\nColumbia. In 2017, the District Court issued its decision denying class certification. On August 16, 2019, the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the District Court’s ruling. The consolidated case is now moving forward without class\ncertification. Although the class was not certified, individual shippers have since brought claims against the railroads, which\nhave been consolidated into a separate case.\nCSXT believes that its fuel surcharge practices were arrived at and applied lawfully and that the case is without merit.","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/CSX_Corporation_-_Form_10-Q(Apr-20-2023).pdf","pdf_numpages":71,"loc":{"lines":{"from":575,"to":614}}}}],["556a9840-03a8-4e67-bb2c-76048051b402",{"pageContent":"have been consolidated into a separate case.\nCSXT believes that its fuel surcharge practices were arrived at and applied lawfully and that the case is without merit.\nAccordingly, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously.

The Property,\nwhich was formerly owned by Pharmacia, is now owned by CSXT. CSXT's indemnification and defense duties arise with\nrespect   to   several   matters.   The   U.S.   Environmental   Protection   Agency   (\"EPA\"),   using   its   CERCLA   authority,   seeks   the\ninvestigation and cleanup of hazardous substances in the 17 -mile Lower Passaic River Study Area (the \"Study Area”). CSXT,\non behalf of Pharmacia, and a significant number of other potentially responsible parties are together conducting a Remedial\nInvestigation  and  Feasibility  Study  of  the  Study  Area  pursuant  to  an  Administrative  Settlement  Agreement  and  Order  on\nConsent with the EPA. Pharmacia’s share of responsibility, indemnified by CSXT, for the investigation and cleanup costs of\nthe Study Area may be determined through various mechanisms including (a) an allocation and settlement with EPA; (b)\nlitigation brought by EPA against non-settling parties; or (c) litigation among the responsible parties.\nFor the lower 8 miles of the Study Area, EPA issued its Record of Decision detailing the agency’s mandated remedial\nprocess in March 2016. Approximately 80 parties, including Pharmacia, are participating in an EPA-directed allocation and\nsettlement   process   to   assign   responsibility   for   the   remedy   selected   for   the   lower  8  miles   of   the   Study   Area.   CSXT   is\nparticipating in the EPA-directed allocation and settlement process on behalf of Pharmacia. For the remainder of the Study\nArea, EPA has selected an interim remedy in a Record of Decision dated September 28, 2021.\nOn March 2, 2022, EPA issued a Notice Letter to Pharmacia, Occidental Chemical Corporation and eight other parties\nalleging they are liable under Section 107(a) of CERCLA for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances and\nrequesting each party, individually or collectively, submit good faith offers to EPA in connection with the Study Area. CSX, on\nbehalf of Pharmacia, responded to the Notice Letter and submitted a good faith offer to EPA on June 27, 2022, following\nmeetings with a mediator from EPA’s Conflict Prevention and Resolution Center. Negotiations with EPA and other parties to\nresolve   this   matter   continue.   On   March   2,   2023,   the   EPA   issued   an   administrative   order   requiring   Occidental   Chemical\nCorporation to design the interim remedy for the remainder of the Study Area.\nCSXT   is   also   defending   and   indemnifying   Pharmacia   with   regard   to   the   Property   in   litigation   filed   by   Occidental\nChemical Corporation, which is seeking to recover various costs. These costs include costs for the remedial design of the\nlower 8 miles of the Study Area, as well as anticipated costs associated with the future remediation of the entire Study Area.\nAlternatively, Occidental seeks to compel some, or all of the defendants to participate in the remediation of the Study Area.\nPharmacia is one of approximately 110 defendants in this federal lawsuit filed by Occidental on June 30, 2018.

Domestic shipments also decreased primarily due to the impacts of a softening truck market.\nCoal Volume\nExport coal increased due to higher shipments of metallurgical and thermal coal, partially due to the prior year\nimpact from reduced capacity at Curtis Bay coal pier. Domestic coal increased due to higher shipments of utility coal\nincluding the benefit of replenishing stockpiles as well as higher steel and industrial shipments.\nTrucking Revenue\nTrucking revenue increased $3 million versus prior year due to higher fuel surcharge.\nOther Revenue\nOther   revenue   was   $24   million   lower   primarily   resulting   from   lower   intermodal   storage   and   equipment   usage,\npartially offset by increases in demurrage and higher affiliate revenue.\nCSX Q1 2023 Form 10-Q p.26","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/CSX_Corporation_-_Form_10-Q(Apr-20-2023).pdf","pdf_numpages":71,"loc":{"lines":{"from":964,"to":1024}}}}],["c320c8c0-6089-41c8-bb75-c9e5b1723b8d",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-GAAP Measures - Unaudited\nCSX reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (U.S. GAAP). CSX also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange\nCommission   Regulation   G   and   Regulation   S-K   Item   10(e),   which   may   provide   users   of   the   financial   information   with\nadditional meaningful comparison to prior reported results.  Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and\nare not defined by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures\npresented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as\na substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP\nmeasures to corresponding GAAP measures are below.\nFree Cash Flow\nManagement   believes   that   free   cash   flow   is   supplemental   information   useful   to   investors   as   it   is   important   in\nevaluating the Company’s financial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business\nafter reinvestment. This measure represents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share\nrepurchases or principal reduction on outstanding debt. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and\nadjusting for property additions and proceeds and advances from property dispositions. Free cash flow should be considered\nin   addition   to,   rather   than   a   substitute   for,   cash   provided   by   operating   activities.   The   decrease   in   free   cash   flow   before\ndividends from the prior year of $160 million is due to higher property additions and less cash from operating activities.\nThe   following   table   reconciles   cash   provided   by   operating   activities   (GAAP   measure)   to   free   cash   flow,   before\ndividends (non-GAAP measure). \nThree Months\n(Dollars in millions)\n20232022\nNet cash provided by operating activities $1,251  $1,299  \nProperty Additions(443)(331)\nProceeds and Advances from Property Dispositions\n8 8 \nFree Cash Flow (before payment of dividends)\n$816 $976 \n(a) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities for three months ended March 31, 2023, includes the impact of $232 million in payments of retroactive wages and bonuses\nrelated to finalized labor agreements.\nOperating Statistics (Estimated)\nThe Company is committed to continuous improvement in safety and service performance through training, innovation\nand   investment.   Training   and   safety   programs   are   designed   to   prevent   incidents   that   can   adversely   impact   employees,\ncustomers and communities. Technological innovations that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents are\ndesigned to serve as an additional layer of protection for the Company's employees. Continued capital investment in the\nCompany's assets, including track, bridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.\nThe FRA train accident rate of 3.47 in first quarter 2023 increased by 20% compared to prior year. The personal injury\nfrequency  index  of  1.04  increased  27%   compared  to  prior  year.  Safety  is   a  guiding  principle  at  CSX,  and  the   Company\nremains focused on instilling safety culture, especially in new hires.

This\ndecrease was partially offset by higher cash-generating income.\n• Cash used in investing activities increased $112 million primarily as a result of higher property additions and higher\nnet purchases of short-term investments.\n• Cash   used   in   financing   activities   increased   $204   million   driven   by   higher   debt   repayments   and   increased   share\nrepurchases.\nSources of Cash and Liquidity and Uses of Cash\nAs of the end of first quarter 2023, CSX had $1.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. CSX\nuses   current   cash   balances   for   general   corporate   purposes,   which   may   include   capital   expenditures,   working   capital\nrequirements, reduction or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness, redemptions and repurchases of CSX common stock,\ndividends   to   shareholders,   acquisitions   and   other   business   opportunities,   and   contributions   to   the   Company's   qualified\npension plan. See Note 7, Debt and Credit Agreements .\nThe Company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. The\nCompany filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on February 16, 2022, which may be used to issue debt or equity\nsecurities at CSX’s discretion, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself\nflexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such\nsecurities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all. During the three months ended 2023, CSX did not issue any\nlong-term debt.\nCSX Q1 2023 Form 10-Q p.30","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/CSX_Corporation_-_Form_10-Q(Apr-20-2023).pdf","pdf_numpages":71,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1172,"to":1202}}}}],["fd08553d-ff17-4d38-b55d-0ee1fa6e09d1",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCSX has a $1.2 billion unsecured, revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in\nFebruary 2028 . At March 31, 2023, the Company had no outstanding balances under this facility. The Company also has a\ncommercial   paper   program,   backed   by   the   revolving   credit   facility,   under   which   the   Company   may   issue   unsecured\ncommercial   paper   notes   up   to   a   maximum   aggregate   principal   amount   of   $1.0   billion   outstanding   at   any   one   time.   At\nMarch 31, 2023, the Company had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program.\nPlanned   capital   investments   for   2023   are   expected   to   be   approximately   $2.3   billion.   Of   the   2023   investment,\napproximately   75%   is   expected   to   be   used   to   sustain   the   core   infrastructure   and   operating   equipment.   The   remaining\namounts will be used to promote profitable growth, including projects supporting service enhancements and productivity. CSX\nintends to fund capital investments primarily through cash generated from operations.\nMaterial Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Working Capital\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nTotal assets decreased $434 million from year end primarily due to the $667 million decrease in cash as noted above.\nThis   decrease   was   partially   offset   by   a   $64   million   increase   in   accounts   receivable,   $42   million   of   which   relates   to   an\ninsurance recovery, as well as a $51 million increase in net property consistent with planned capital expenditures.\nTotal liabilities decreased $143 million from year end primarily due to a $340 million decrease in labor and fringe\nbenefits   payable   and   a   $140   million   decrease   in   current   debt   driven   by   the   maturity   of   secured   equipment   notes.   The\ndecrease in labor and fringe benefits payable was driven by payouts of accrued retroactive wages and bonuses as well as\nincentive compensation. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in income and other taxes payable of $250\nmillion due to the timing of tax payments. Total shareholders' equity decreased $291 million from year end primarily driven by\nshare repurchases of $1.1 billion and dividends paid of $226 million, partially offset by net earnings of $987 million.\nWorking capital is considered a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working\ncapital surplus of $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2023 and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. This decrease of $344 million\nsince year end is primarily due to cash paid for share repurchases of $1.1 billion, property additions of $443 million and\ndividends paid of $226 million, partially offset by cash from operations. The Company's working capital balance varies due to\nfactors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as discussed\nabove. The Company continues to maintain adequate liquidity to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they\ncome due. CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and shelf\nregistration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. The Company from time\nto time accesses the credit markets for additional liquidity.\nCSX Q1 2023 Form 10-Q p.31","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/CSX_Corporation_-_Form_10-Q(Apr-20-2023).pdf","pdf_numpages":71,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1204,"to":1236}}}}],["c5ed78c1-6e73-4adf-aaa7-face8b1fe1b2",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2.

Capital\nstructure,   capital   investments   and   cash   distributions,   including   dividends   and   share   repurchases,   are   reviewed   at   least\nannually by the Board of Directors. Management's assessment of market conditions and other factors guides the timing and\nvolume   of   repurchases.   Future   share   repurchases   are   expected   to   be   funded   by   cash   on   hand,   cash   generated   from\noperations and debt issuances.\nCompleted Transactions\nAcquisition of Pan Am Systems, Inc.\nOn June 1, 2022, CSX acquired Pan Am for a purchase price of $600 million. The results of Pan Am's operations and\nits cash flows were consolidated prospectively.\nSale of Property Rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three\nCSX-owned line segments to the Commonwealth of Virginia (“Commonwealth”) over three phases. The timing and amount of\ngains recognized were based on the allocation of fair value to each conveyance, the timing of conveyances and collectability.\nOver the course of this transaction, which was completed in 2022, total proceeds of $525 million were collected and total\ngains of $493 million were recognized. A gain of $20 million was recognized in first quarter 2022 related to the closing of the\nsecond phase.\nGuaranteed Notes Issued By CSXT\nIn 2007, CSXT, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSX Corporation, issued in a registered public offering $381 million of\nequipment notes, which were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by CSX Corporation. These notes matured on January 15,\n2023.\nIn   accordance   with   SEC   rules,   including   amendments   adopted   in   2020,   CSX   is   not   required   to   present   separate\ncondensed consolidating financial information for wholly-owned subsidiaries who issued or guaranteed notes.

Business\nCSX Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (\"CSX\" or the “Company”), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the\nnation's leading transportation companies. The Company provides rail-based freight transportation services including traditional\nrail service, the transport of intermodal containers and trailers, as well as other transportation services such as rail-to-truck\ntransfers  and  bulk  commodity  operations.  CSX  and  the  rail  industry  provide  customers  with  access  to  an  expansive  and\ninterconnected  transportation  network  that  plays  a  key  role  in  North  American  commerce  and  is  critical  to  the  long-term\neconomic success and improved global competitiveness of the United States. In addition, freight railroads provide the most\neconomical and environmentally efficient means to transport goods over land.\nCSX Transportation, Inc.\nCSX’s principal operating subsidiary, CSX Transportation, Inc. (“CSXT”), provides an important link to the transportation\nsupply chain through its approximately 19,500 route-mile rail network, which serves major population centers in 23 states east of\nthe Mississippi River, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. It has access to over 70\nocean, river and lake port terminals along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St.\nLawrence Seaway. This access allows the Company to meet the dynamic transportation needs of manufacturers, industrial\nproducers, the automotive industry, construction companies, farmers and feed mills, wholesalers and retailers, and energy\nproducers.  The  Company’s  intermodal  business  links  customers  to  railroads  via  trucks  and  terminals.  CSXT  also  serves\nthousands of production and distribution facilities through track connections with other Class I railroads and more than 230 short-\nline and regional railroads.\nCSXT is also responsible for the Company's real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development\nactivities. Substantially all of these activities are focused on supporting railroad operations.\nOther Entities\nIn  addition  to  CSXT,  the  Company’s  subsidiaries  include  Quality  Carriers,  Inc.  (\"Quality  Carriers\"),  CSX  Intermodal\nTerminals,  Inc.  (“CSX  Intermodal  Terminals”),  Total  Distribution  Services,  Inc.  (“TDSI”),  Transflo  Terminal  Services,  Inc.\n(“Transflo”), CSX Technology, Inc. (“CSX Technology”) and other subsidiaries. Effective July 1, 2021, CSX acquired Quality\nCarriers, the largest provider of bulk liquid chemicals truck transportation in North America, from Quality Distribution, Inc. For\nfurther details, refer to Note 17, Business Combinations. CSX Intermodal Terminals owns and operates a system of intermodal\nterminals, predominantly in the eastern United States, and also provides drayage services (the pickup and delivery of intermodal\nshipments) for certain customers. TDSI serves the automotive industry with distribution centers and storage locations. Transflo\nconnects non-rail served customers to the many benefits of rail by transferring products from rail to trucks. The biggest Transflo\nmarkets  are  chemicals  and  agriculture,  which  includes  shipments  of  plastics  and  ethanol.  CSX  Technology  and  other\nsubsidiaries provide support services for the Company.\nOperating Model\nThe Company is focused on developing and strictly maintaining a scheduled service plan with an emphasis on optimizing\nassets. When this operating model is executed effectively, customer service is improved, enabling the Company to better\ncompete for an increased share of the U.S. freight market. Further, this model leads to reduced costs and strong free cash flow\ngeneration.\nCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.3","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":98,"to":136}}}}],["fc926dae-db97-4f52-ba32-1514399a043c",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART I\nLines of Business\nDuring 2021, the Company's services generated $12.5 billion of revenue and served four primary lines of business:\nmerchandise, intermodal, coal and trucking.\n•The merchandise business shipped 2.6 million carloads (41% of volume) and generated 60% of revenue in 2021. The\nCompany’s merchandise business is comprised of shipments in the following diverse markets: chemicals, agricultural\nand food products, minerals, automotive, forest products, metals and equipment, and fertilizers.\n•The intermodal business shipped 3.0 million units (48% of volume) and generated 16% of revenue in 2021. The\nintermodal business combines the superior economics of rail transportation with the flexibility of trucks and offers a\ncost and environmental advantage over long-haul trucking. Through a network of approximately 30 terminals, the\nintermodal  business  serves  all  major  markets  east  of  the  Mississippi  River  and  transports  mainly  manufactured\nconsumer goods in containers, providing customers with truck-like service for longer shipments.\n•The coal business shipped 706 thousand carloads (11% of volume) and generated 14% of revenue in 2021. The\nCompany transports domestic coal, coke and iron ore to electricity-generating power plants, steel manufacturers and\nindustrial plants as well as export coal to deep-water port facilities. Approximately one-quarter of export coal and the\nmajority of the domestic coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity or industrial purposes.\n•The trucking business generated 3% of revenue in 2021. Trucking revenue includes revenue from the operations of\nQuality Carriers, which was acquired by CSX effective July 1, 2021.\nOther revenue accounted for 7% of the Company’s total revenue in 2021. This category includes revenue from regional\nsubsidiary  railroads  and  incidental  charges,  including  intermodal  storage  and  equipment  usage,  demurrage  and  switching.\nRevenue  from  regional  subsidiary  railroads  includes  shipments  by  railroads  that  the  Company  does  not  directly  operate.\nIntermodal storage represents charges for customer storage of containers at an intermodal terminal, ramp facility or offsite\nlocation beyond a specified period of time. Demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held by a customer\nbeyond a specified period of time. Switching represents charges assessed when a railroad switches cars for a customer or\nanother railroad.\nCSX's Committed Workforce\nMost of the Company’s employees provide or support transportation services. The Company had more than 20,900\nemployees as of December 2021, which includes approximately 16,500 employees that are members of a labor union. For the\n13 rail unions that participate in national bargaining, a round of negotiations for benefits, wages and work rules is underway.\nTypically, these negotiations take several years. Current agreements remain in place until modified by new agreements.\nCSX  prioritizes  workplace  safety  for  employees  and  is  committed  to  continued  improvement  through  enhanced\nprocesses, training, technology, communication, and continuous collaboration with customers and peers across the railroad\nindustry. Training programs and processes are focused on injury and accident prevention as well as emergency preparedness.\nThe attainment of key safety targets is a component of management's annual incentive program. The FRA Personal Injury\nFrequency Index, a measure of the number of FRA-reportable injuries per 200,000 man-hours, was 0.92 in 2021 and 0.82 in\n2020, representing a 12% increase year over year.\nCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.4","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":138,"to":175}}}}],["ea65b61c-5a01-4c7e-aa92-d429d2faaef2",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART I\nIn response to the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic, additional policies and procedures were developed to\nprotect the health and safety of employees. A cross-functional task force continues to monitor the situation to ensure that\nappropriate safety measures are being taken.\nThe Compensation and Talent Management Committee of the Board of Directors is charged with oversight of CSX's\nworkforce. The Company is committed to developing a culture that promotes workforce diversity and inclusion and encourages\nethical behavior. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 20% of CSX's overall workforce and 37% of management was\ndiverse, calculated as the percentage of males of color and all females. In 2021, CSX was recognized as a “Best Place to Work\nfor Disability Inclusion” by Disability:IN and the American Association of People with Disabilities for a third consecutive year after\nreceiving a top score on their disability equality index. The CSX Code of Ethics serves as a guiding standard for ethical behavior\nand  covers  many  types  of  matters,  including  discrimination  and  harassment  as  well  as  safety.  Annually,  all  management\nemployees are required, and union employees are highly encouraged, to complete ethics training.\nCompany History\nA leader in freight rail transportation for more than 190 years, the Company’s heritage dates back to the early nineteenth\ncentury when The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company (“B&O”), the nation’s first common carrier, was chartered in 1827.\nSince that time, the Company has built on this foundation to create a railroad that could safely and reliably service the ever-\nincreasing demands of a growing nation. Since its founding, numerous railroads have combined with the former B&O through\nmerger and consolidation to create what has become CSX. Each of the railroads that combined into the CSX family brought new\ngeographical reach to valuable markets, gateways, cities, ports and transportation corridors.\nCSX Corporation was incorporated in 1978 under Virginia law. In 1980, the Company completed the merger of the\nChessie  System  and  Seaboard  Coast  Line  Industries  into  CSX.  The  merger  allowed  the  Company  to  connect  northern\npopulation  centers  and  Appalachian  coal  fields  to  growing  southeastern  markets.  Later,  the  Company’s  acquisition  of  key\nportions of Conrail, Inc. (\"Conrail\") allowed CSXT to link the northeast, including New England and the New York metropolitan\narea, with Chicago and midwestern markets as well as the growing areas in the Southeast already served by CSXT. This current\nrail network allows the Company to directly serve every major market in the eastern United States with safe, dependable,\nenvironmentally responsible and fuel efficient freight transportation and intermodal service.\nCompetition\n    The business environment in which the Company operates is highly competitive. Shippers typically select transportation\nproviders that offer the most compelling combination of service and price. Service requirements, both in terms of transit time and\nreliability, vary by shipper and commodity. As a result, the Company’s primary competition varies by commodity, geographic\nlocation and mode of available transportation and includes other railroads, motor carriers that operate similar routes across its\nservice area and, to a less significant extent, barges, ships and pipelines.\n    CSXT’s primary rail competitor is Norfolk Southern Railway, which operates throughout much of the Company’s territory.\nOther railroads also operate in parts of the Company’s territory. Depending on the specific market, competing railroads and\nderegulated motor carriers may exert pressure on price and service levels.

In the U.S., the railroad operations conducted by the\nCompany's subsidiaries, including CSXT, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”),\nthe Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”), and its sister agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation (\"DOT\"), the\nPipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”). Together, FRA and PHMSA have broad jurisdiction over\nrailroad operating standards and practices, including track, freight cars, locomotives and hazardous materials requirements. In\naddition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has regulatory authority with respect to matters that impact the\nCompany's properties and operations. \n    The Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), a component of the Department of Homeland Security, has broad\nauthority over railroad operating practices that may have homeland security implications. In Canada, the railroad operations\nconducted  by  the  Company’s  subsidiaries,  including  CSXT,  are  subject  to  the  regulatory  jurisdiction  of  the  Canadian\nTransportation Agency.\n    Although the Staggers Act of 1980 significantly deregulated the U.S. rail industry, the STB has broad jurisdiction over rail\ncarriers. The STB regulates routes, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, rates for non-exempt traffic, acquisitions of control\nover rail common carriers and the transfer, extension or abandonment of rail lines, among other railroad activities. Any new rules\nfrom the STB regarding, among other things, competitive access or revenue adequacy could have a material adverse effect on\nthe Company's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity as well as its ability to invest in enhancing and maintaining\nvital infrastructure.

In addition, statutes or regulations imposing price constraints or affecting rail-to-rail competition could adversely affect\nthe Company's profitability.\n \nGovernment regulation and compliance risks may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial results.\nThe Company is subject to the jurisdiction of various regulatory agencies, including the STB, FRA, PHMSA, TSA, EPA\nand other state, provincial and federal regulatory agencies for a variety of economic, health, safety, labor, environmental, tax,\nlegal and other matters. New or modified rules or regulations by these agencies could increase the Company's operating costs,\nadversely impact revenue or reduce operating efficiencies and affect service performance. Noncompliance with applicable laws\nor regulations could erode public confidence in the Company and can subject the Company to fines, penalties and other legal or\nregulatory sanctions.\nCSXT,  as  a  common  carrier by  rail,  is  required  by  law  to  transport  hazardous materials,  which  could  expose  the\nCompany to significant costs and claims.\nA train accident involving the transport of hazardous materials could result in significant claims arising from personal\ninjury, property or natural resource damage, environmental penalties and remediation obligations. Such claims, if insured, could\nexceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Under\nfederal regulations, CSXT is required to transport hazardous materials under the legal duty referred to as the common carrier\nmandate.\nCSXT is also required to comply with regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials. In November 2008, the\nTSA issued final rules placing significant new security and safety requirements on passenger and freight railroad carriers, rail\ntransit systems and facilities that ship hazardous materials by rail. Noncompliance with these rules can subject the Company to\nsignificant penalties and could be a factor in litigation arising out of a train accident. Finally, legislation preventing the transport of\nhazardous materials through certain cities could result in network congestion and increase the length of haul for hazardous\nsubstances, which could increase operating costs, reduce operating efficiency or increase the risk of an accident involving the\ntransport of hazardous materials.\nCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.7","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":256,"to":293}}}}],["d672174f-1dfc-4467-8524-16e8df885075",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART I\nThe Company may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures.\nAs part of its railroad and other operations, the Company is subject to various claims and lawsuits related to disputes\nover  commercial  practices,  labor  and  unemployment  matters,  occupational  and  personal  injury  claims,  property  damage,\nenvironmental and other matters.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic also increases the risk that the Company or\nits third-party vendors may experience cybersecurity incidents as a result of employees, third-party vendors and other third\nparties with which they interact working remotely on less secure systems and environments.\nDespite the Company’s efforts to protect its information technology systems, it may not be able to prevent or anticipate all\ndata breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents, detect or react to such incidents in a timely manner or adequately\nremediate  any  such  incident.  While  CSX’s  security  protocols  have  detected  attempts  to  gain  unauthorized  access  to  the\nCompany’s information technology systems, none of such attempts have resulted in any material breach of or disruption to the\nCompany’s systems. For example, CSX has experienced distributed denial of service attacks that have resulted in brief system\ndisruptions,  but  none  have  resulted  in  access  to  CSX  systems.  Additionally,  despite  routine  security  assessment  of  the\nCompany’s key third-party vendors, some vendors have experienced cyber-attacks in the past, but none of such attacks have\nhad  a  material  adverse  impact  on  CSX’s  business  or  operations.  Due  to  applicable  laws  and  regulations  or  contractual\nobligations, CSX may be held responsible for data breaches, cyber-attacks or other similar incidents attributed to its third-party\nvendors as they relate to the information CSX shares with them.\nNetwork  or  supply  chain  constraints  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  service,  operating  efficiency  or  volume  of\nshipments.\nCSXT could experience rail network difficulties related to: (i) unpredictable increases in demand; (ii) locomotive or crew\nshortages; (iii) labor shortages or other service disruptions in the supply chain affecting trucking, ports, handling facilities,\ncustomer facilities or other railroads; (iv) reductions in availability of pooled equipment, including chassis; (v) extreme weather\nconditions; (vi) impacts from changes in yard capacity, or network structure or composition, including train routes; (vii) increased\npassenger activities; or (viii) regulatory changes resulting in forced access or impacting where and how fast CSXT can transport\nfreight or maintain routes, which could impact CSXT's operational fluidity, leading to deterioration of service, asset utilization and\noverall efficiency.\nFuture acts of terrorism, war or regulatory changes to combat the risk of terrorism may cause significant disruptions in\nthe Company's operations.\nTerrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect the Company's financial\ncondition, results of operations or liquidity.

For example, the Department of Homeland Security adopted regulations that require freight railroads to implement\nadditional security protocols when transporting hazardous materials. Complying with these or future regulations could continue\nto increase the Company's operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies.\nSevere weather or other natural occurrences could result in significant business interruptions and expenditures in\nexcess of available insurance coverage.\nThe Company's operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences,\nincluding floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes. As a result, the Company's rail network may be damaged, its workforce may\nbe  unavailable,  fuel  costs  may  rise  and  significant  business  interruptions  could  occur.  In  addition,  the  performance  of\nlocomotives and railcars could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance maintained by the Company to\nprotect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage\nlimitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the Company's\ndamages or damages to others, and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even\nwith insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, the Company may not be able to restore\nservice without a significant interruption in operations.\nCompetitive, Economic and Financial\nThe Company faces competition from other transportation providers.\nThe  Company  experiences  competition  in  pricing,  service,  reliability  and  other  factors  from  various  transportation\nproviders including railroads and motor carriers that operate similar routes across its service area and, to a less significant\nextent,  barges,  ships  and  pipelines.  Other  transportation  providers  generally  use  public  rights-of-way  that  are  built  and\nmaintained by governmental entities, while CSXT and other railroads must build and maintain rail networks largely using internal\nresources. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of alternative modes\nof transportation such as through the use of automation, autonomy or electrification, or legislation providing for less stringent\nsize  or  weight  restrictions  on  trucks,  could  negatively  impact  the  Company's  competitive  position.  Additionally,  any  future\nconsolidation in the rail industry could materially affect the regulatory and competitive environment in which the Company\noperates.\nGlobal economic conditions could negatively affect demand for commodities and other freight.\nA decline or disruption in general domestic and global economic conditions that affects demand for the commodities and\nproducts the Company transports, including import and export volume, could reduce revenues or have other adverse effects on\nthe Company's cost structure and profitability. For example, slower rates of economic growth in Asia, contraction of European\neconomies, and changes in the global supply of seaborne coal or price of seaborne coal have adverse impacts on U.S. export\ncoal volume and result in lower coal revenue for CSX. Additionally, changes to trade agreements or policies could result in\nreduced  import  and  export  volumes  due  to  increased  tariffs  and  lower  consumer  demand.

Changes in natural gas prices, or other factors impacting demand for electricity,\ncould  impact  future  power  generation  at  coal-fired  plants,  which  would  affect  the  Company's  domestic  coal  volumes  and\nrevenues.\nWeaknesses in the capital and credit markets could negatively impact the Company’s access to capital.\nThe Company regularly relies on capital markets for the issuance of long-term debt instruments, commercial paper and\nbank financing from time to time. Instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including credit markets, or the deterioration of\nthe  Company’s  financial  condition  due  to  internal  or  external  factors,  could  restrict  or  prohibit  access  and  could  increase\nfinancing costs. A significant deterioration of the Company’s financial condition could also reduce credit ratings and could limit or\naffect its access to external sources of capital and increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.\nAvailability of Critical Supplies and Labor\nThe unavailability of critical resources could adversely affect the Company’s operational efficiency and ability to meet\ndemand.\nMarketplace  conditions  for  resources  like  locomotives  as  well  as  the  availability  of  qualified  personnel,  particularly\nengineers  and  conductors,  could  each have  a  negative  impact  on  the  Company’s  ability  to meet  demand  for  rail  service.\nAlthough  the  Company  strives  to  maintain  adequate  resources  and  personnel  for  the  current  business  environment,\nunpredictable increases in demand for rail services or extreme weather conditions may exacerbate such risks, which could have\na negative impact on the Company’s operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nfinancial condition, results of operations, or liquidity in a particular period.\nDisruption to a key railroad industry supplier could negatively affect operating efficiency and increase costs.\nThe  capital  intensive  and  unique  nature  of  core  rail  equipment  (including  rail,  ties,  rolling  stock  equipment  and\nlocomotives)  limits  the  number  of  railroad  equipment  suppliers.  If  any  of  the  current  manufacturers  stops  production  or\nexperiences a supply shortage, CSXT could experience a significant cost increase or material shortage. In addition, a few critical\nrailroad suppliers are foreign and, as such, adverse developments in international relations, new trade regulations, disruptions in\ninternational  shipping  or  increases  in  global  demand  could  make  procurement  of  these  supplies  more  difficult  or  increase\nCSXT's costs. Additionally, if a fuel supply shortage were to arise, the Company would be negatively impacted.\nFailure to complete negotiations on collective bargaining agreements could result in strikes and/or work stoppages.\nMost of CSX's employees are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These\nagreements are either bargained for nationally by the National Carriers Conference Committee or locally between CSX and the\nunion. Such agreements are negotiated over the course of several years and previously have not resulted in any extended work\nstoppages. Under the Railway Labor Act's procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods and the possibility of an\nintervention by the President of the United States), during negotiations neither party may take action until the procedures are\nexhausted.

This route, also known as the “waterlevel route,” has minimal hills and grades and nearly all of it has two main tracks\n(referred to as double track). These engineering attributes permit the corridor to support high-speed service across intermodal,\nautomotive and merchandise commodities. This corridor is a primary route for import traffic coming from the far east through\nwestern ports moving eastward across the country, through Chicago and into the population centers in the Northeast. The I-90\nCorridor is also a critical link between ports in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania and consumption markets in the\nMidwest. This route carries goods from all three of the Company’s major markets – merchandise, intermodal and coal.\nInterstate  95  (I-95)  Corridor –  The  CSXT  I-95  Corridor  connects  Charleston,  Jacksonville,  Miami  and  many  other  cities\nthroughout the Southeast with the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern cities of Baltimore, Philadelphia and New\nYork. CSXT primarily transports food and consumer products, as well as metals and chemicals along this line. It is the leading\nrail corridor along the eastern seaboard south of the District of Columbia and provides access to major eastern ports.\nSoutheastern Corridor – This critical part of the network runs between CSXT’s western gateways of Chicago, St. Louis and\nMemphis through the cities of Nashville, Birmingham, and Atlanta and markets in the Southeast. The Southeastern Corridor is\nthe premier rail route connecting these key cities, gateways, and markets and positions CSXT to efficiently handle projected\ntraffic volumes of intermodal, automotive and general merchandise traffic. The corridor also provides direct rail service between\nthe coal reserves of the southern Illinois basin and the demand for coal in the Southeast.\nCoal Network – The CSXT coal network connects the coal mining operations in the Appalachian mountain region and Illinois\nbasin with industrial areas in the Southeast, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, as well as many river, lake, and deep water port\nfacilities. The domestic coal market has declined significantly over the last decade and export coal remains subject to a high\ndegree of volatility. CSXT’s coal network remains well positioned to supply utility markets in both the Northeast and Southeast\nand to transport coal shipments for export outside of the U.S. Approximately one-quarter of export coal and the majority of the\ndomestic coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity or industrial purposes.\n    See the following page for a map of the CSX Rail Network.

Total purchased services and other expenses increased $416 million driven by the following:\n•The inclusion of Quality Carriers' operations drove $257 million of additional costs.\n•Higher operating support costs, primarily due to an increased active locomotive fleet, as well as higher intermodal\nterminal costs drove an increase of $80 million.\n•All other costs increased $79 million primarily due to inflation and other non-significant costs, including $17 million\nin expenses related to the acquisition of Quality Carriers.\nDepreciation expense  primarily  relates  to  recognizing  the  costs  of  capital  assets,  such  as  locomotives,  railcars  and  track\nstructure, over their respective useful lives, which are reviewed periodically as part of depreciation studies. This expense is\nimpacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. Depreciation expense increased $37 million primarily due to a\nlarger  net  asset  base,  which  includes  Quality  Carriers'  assets,  partially  offset  by  the  impacts  of  the  2020  road  and  track\ndepreciation study.\nFuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel as well as non-locomotive fuel. This expense is largely driven by the market price\nand locomotive consumption of diesel fuel. Fuel expense increased $372 million primarily due to a 55% price increase in\nlocomotive fuel prices and the inclusion of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking.\nEquipment and Other Rents expense includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of\nrents received by CSXT for use of its equipment. This category of expenses also includes expenses for short-term and long-term\nleases of locomotives, railcars, containers, tractors and trailers, offices and other rentals. These expenses increased $26 million\nprimarily due to increased car hire costs driven by higher days per load and the addition of Quality Carriers' costs, partially offset\nby other non-significant items.\nGains on Property Dispositions increased to $454 million in 2021 from $35 million in 2020 primarily due to the conveyance of a\npermanent land easement to the Commonwealth of Virginia that resulted in a $349 million gain in April 2021 as well as other\nproperty dispositions throughout 2021.\nCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.28","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":989,"to":1029}}}}],["874b4ede-40ce-4e26-a128-3fd890a3de6e",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nInterest Expense\nInterest Expense includes interest on long-term debt, equipment obligations and finance leases.

Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s\nnon-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure\nrepresents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction\non outstanding debt. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and\ncertain other investing activities, which includes proceeds from property dispositions. This measure should be considered in\naddition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. Free cash flow before dividends increased $1.2\nbillion year-over-year to $3.8 billion primarily due to higher net cash provided by operating activities and higher proceeds and\nadvances  from  property  dispositions,  including  $400  million  of  proceeds  related  to  the  conveyance  of  a  permanent  land\neasement to the Commonwealth of Virginia in 2021.

Further,\nCSX is well positioned from a liquidity standpoint. The Company ended the year with $2.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and\nshort-term investments.\n    Total assets as well as total liabilities and shareholders' equity increased $738 million from prior year end. The increase in\ntotal  assets  was  primarily  due  to  a  net  increase  in  property  of  $571  million  attributable  to  capital  expenditures  and  the\nconsolidation of Quality Carrier's properties, the recognition of $393 million of goodwill and intangible assets related to the\nacquisition of Quality Carriers, a $236 million increase in accounts receivable commensurate with higher revenue and a $226\nmillion increase in net assets for qualified pension plans primarily driven by favorable discount rates. These increases were\npartially offset by the $890 million decrease in cash described above.\nTotal liabilities increased $348 million from year end primarily due to an increase in deferred tax liabilities of $215 million\ndriven by accelerated tax depreciation, an increase in accounts payable of $154 million due to the timing of payments, an\nincrease in labor and fringe benefit payable of $148 million partly due higher expected incentive compensation payouts, the\nassumption of $68 million in debt as a result of the acquisition of Quality Carriers, and an increase in income and other taxes\npayable of $61 million. These and other increases were offset by debt repayments of $426 million. Total shareholders' equity\nincreased $390 million from year end primarily driven by net earnings of nearly $3.8 billion, mostly offset by share repurchases\nof $2.9 billion and dividends paid of $839 million.\n    Working capital is considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital\nsurplus of $1.6 billion at December 2021 and $2.4 billion at December 2020, a decrease of $782 million. The decrease in current\nassets was primarily driven by the net decrease in cash described above, partially offset by the increase in accounts receivable.\nThe increase in current liabilities was due to higher accounts payable and labor and fringe payable, partially offset by lower\ncurrent maturities of long-term debt.\n    The Company’s working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in\ncash and cash equivalent balances. Although the Company currently has a surplus, a working capital deficit is not unusual for\nCSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity.

Significant estimates using management judgment are made for the\nfollowing areas:\n•personal injury and environmental reserves;\n•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;\n•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and\n•goodwill and other intangible assets.\nPersonal Injury and Environmental Reserves\nPersonal Injury\n    Personal Injury reserves of $118 million and $131 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, represent liabilities for employee\nwork-related and third-party injuries. CSXT retains an independent actuary to assist management in assessing the value of\npersonal injury claims. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the\nvalue of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT's historical claims and settlement experience. Actual results\nmay vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in\nlitigation. For additional details, including a description of our related accounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental\nand Other Reserves, in the consolidated financial statements.\nEnvironmental\n    Environmental reserves were $108 million and $76 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company is a party to various\nproceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private parties and\nregulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 220 environmentally\nimpaired sites. The Company reviews its potential liability with respect to each site identified, giving consideration to a number of\nfactors such as:\n•type of clean-up required;\n•nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or\noperator of the site);\n•extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors);\nand\n•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.\nCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.40","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1410,"to":1448}}}}],["cff56a0c-687b-4d27-81a6-c9d91cf4cacb",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nCritical Accounting Estimates, continued    \nConditions  that  are  currently  unknown  could,  at  any  given  location,  result  in  additional  exposure,  the  amount  and\nmateriality of which cannot presently be reasonably estimated. For additional details, including a description of our related\naccounting policies, see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, in the consolidated financial statements.\nPension and Post-retirement Medical Plan Accounting\n    The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. For employees hired\nprior  to  2003,  the  plans  provide  eligible  employees  with  retirement  benefits  based  predominantly  on  years  of  service  and\ncompensation rates near retirement. For employees hired between 2003 and 2019, benefits are determined based on a cash\nbalance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation.\nBeginning in 2020, the CSX Pension Plan was closed to new participants. As of December 2021, the projected benefit obligation\nfor the Company’s pension plans was $3.0 billion.\nIn addition to these plans, the Company sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and a life insurance plan that provide\ncertain  benefits  to  full-time,  salaried,  management  employees  hired  prior  to  2003  upon  their  retirement  if  certain  eligibility\nrequirements are met. Beginning in 2019, both the life insurance benefit for eligible active management employees and health\nsavings account contributions made by the Company to eligible retirees younger than 65 were eliminated. Beginning in 2020, the\nemployer-funded health reimbursement arrangements for eligible retirees 65 years or older were eliminated. As of December\n2021, the projected benefit obligation for the Company’s other post-retirement benefit plans was $81 million.\nFor information related to the funded status of the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, see Note\n9, Employee Benefit Plans.\n    The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in the Compensation-Retirement Benefits Topic in the\nASC. This rule requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:\n•discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;\n•long-term rate of return on plan assets;\n•salary scale inflation rates; and\n•other assumptions.\n    The Company engages independent actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans\nsubject to the assumptions that the Company determines are appropriate based on historical trends, current market rates and\nfuture projections. These amounts are reviewed by management.\nCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.41","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1450,"to":1480}}}}],["14d923be-b19c-45f4-abd0-8ba880304de8",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nCritical Accounting Estimates, continued\nDiscount Rates\n    Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the service and interest cost components of pension and post-\nretirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively\nsettled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to\nthe Company's expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on the market yield as of\nyear-end for high quality corporate bonds whose maturities match the plans' expected benefit payments.\n    The Company measures the service and interest cost components of the net pension and post-retirement benefits expense by\nusing individual spot rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot\ndiscount rates along the same high quality corporate bonds yield curve used to measure the pension and post-retirement benefit\nliabilities are applied to the relevant projected cash flows at the relevant maturity.\nThe weighted average discount rates used by the Company to value its 2021 pension and post-retirement obligations are\n2.78% and 2.51%, respectively. For 2020, the weighted average discount rates used by the Company to value its pension and\npost-retirement obligations were 2.43% and 2.07%, respectively. Discount rates may differ for pension and post-retirement\nbenefits due to varying duration of the liabilities for projected payments for each plan. As of December 2021, the estimated\nduration of pensions and post-retirement benefits is approximately 12 years and 8 years, respectively.\n    Each year, these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted using the current market interest rates for high quality corporate\nbonds to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. In general, if interest rates decline or rise, the\nassumed discount rates will change.\nLong-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets\n    The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds\ninvested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the\nCompany gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return\nexpected to be available for reinvestment as well as the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management, with the\nassistance of an outsourced investment manager, balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers\nwith both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on\nassets. As this assumption is long term, the annual review may result in less frequent adjustment than other assumptions used\nin pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its benefit cost for the\nsubsequent plan year was 6.75% in both 2021 and 2020.\nSalary Scale Inflation Rates\n    Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company\nreviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of\nsalary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 4.60% in both 2021 and 2020 to value its pension\nobligations.\nOther Assumptions\n    The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to health care cost trend rates, mortality rates,\nturnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data, recent plan experience and industry trends and\nare determined by management.\nCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.42","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1482,"to":1522}}}}],["32ad82f8-4bee-476d-ad38-d0f2d1e263d7",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nCritical Accounting Estimates, continued\n2022 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement Expense\n    Net periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expenses for 2022 are expected to be credits of $42 million and $5 million,\nrespectively.

Net periodic pension expense and post-retirement benefits expense in 2021 were credits of $17 million and $5 million,\nrespectively.

The Company depreciates its railroad assets,\nincluding main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method of accounting. Assets depreciated under the\ngroup-life method comprise 86% of total fixed assets of $46.5 billion on a gross basis at December 31, 2021. The remaining\ndepreciable assets of the Company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the\nstraight-line method on a per asset basis. Land is not depreciated.\n    Management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method, the\nservice lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and\napplying management’s methods to determine the service lives of its properties. There are several factors taken into account\nduring the depreciation study and they include:\n•statistical analysis of historical life and salvage data for each group of property;\n•statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;\n•evaluation of current operations;\n•evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;\n•previous assessment of the condition of the assets;\n•management's outlook on the future use of certain asset groups;\n•expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and\n•comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.\nCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.43","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1524,"to":1562}}}}],["53a30f67-d415-4c1c-a954-b01738769155",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nCritical Accounting Estimates, continued    \nThe STB requires depreciation studies be performed every three years for equipment assets (e.g., locomotives and\nfreight cars) and every six years for road and track assets (e.g., bridges, signals, rail, ties, and ballast). The Company completed\na depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2019, both of which resulted in changes to\naccumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain assets. Recent experience with\ndepreciation studies has resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation and depreciation rates that did not materially affect the\nCompany's depreciation expense of $1.4 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A 1% change\nin the average estimated useful life of all group-life assets would result in an approximate $12 million change to the Company’s\nannual depreciation expense.

CSX  recognized\n$213 million of goodwill and $180 million of intangible assets as a result of the Quality Carriers acquisition effective July 1, 2021.\nIn applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, management must determine the fair value\nof assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between depreciable and\namortizable assets and goodwill. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are\nbased  on  management’s  estimates  and  assumptions,  as  well  as  other  information  compiled  by  management,  including\nvaluations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited\nto, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital.\nCSX evaluates goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or sooner if indicators of impairment\nexist. In performing the qualitative impairment assessment, CSX considers relevant events and conditions, including but not\nlimited to: macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, company-specific events, and\nlegal and regulatory factors. If the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the\nreporting unit or intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts, the Company would perform a quantitative impairment\ntest. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill or intangible asset exceeded the fair value under the quantitative test,\nan impairment loss would be recorded. Measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit could be based on one or more of the\nfollowing fair value measures: amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between\nwilling parties, present value techniques of estimated future cash flows, valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or\nrevenue, or a similar performance measure.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Policy\n    See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies under the caption “New Accounting Pronouncements\nand Changes in Accounting Policy.”\nCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.44","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1564,"to":1598}}}}],["c4f2a6c5-1d21-49d7-81e7-f540be2a558f",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n    Certain statements in this report and in other materials filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as\ninformation included in oral statements or other written statements made by the Company, are forward-looking statements.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n \nChanges in interest rates may impact the cost of future long-term debt issued by the Company, and as a result, represent\ninterest rate risk to the Company. In an effort to manage this risk, CSX may use certain financial instruments such as interest\nrate forward contracts. The following information, together with information included in Note 10, Debt and Credit Agreements,\ndescribes the key aspects of such contracts and the related market risk to CSX.\nChanges in interest rates could impact the fair value of the Company's forward starting interest rate swap. On both April\n29, 2020, and July 9, 2020, the Company executed a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional value of $250 million for\nan aggregate notional value of $500 million. These swaps were effected to hedge the benchmark interest rate associated with\nfuture interest payments related to the anticipated refinancing of notes due in 2027.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, continued\nDepreciation Policies for Assets Utilizing the Group-Life Method\nDescription of the\nMatter\nAt December 31, 2021, assets depreciated under the group-life method comprised 86% of total gross fixed\nassets of $46.5 billion. As discussed in Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements, the group-life method\naggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these groups as a\nwhole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole,\nis used and depreciated to the end of the group’s recoverable life. The Company utilizes different depreciable\nasset categories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the\ngroup-life method.\nUnder the group-life method, depreciation studies are completed to review asset service lives, salvage values,\naccumulated depreciation and other factors related to group assets. Depreciation studies are performed every\nthree years for equipment assets and every six years for road and track assets. A depreciation study was\nperformed in 2019 for equipment assets and 2020 for road and track assets. The most recent depreciation\nstudies are reviewed by management each year through an annual data review to determine if there have\nbeen significant factors that result in changes to the group-life method key assumptions.\nAuditing depreciation expense for assets subject to the group-life method was complex and required the\ninvolvement of specialists due to the nature of the methods used in the depreciation studies to determine the\nuseful service lives and salvage values of the Company’s assets. These methods have a significant effect on\ndepreciation expense.\nHow We Addressed\nthe Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over\nthe Company’s process related to the assessment of periodic depreciation studies and annual data reviews of\nits  group-life  assets.  For  example,  we  tested  controls  over  management’s  review  of  asset  activity  and\nassumptions that could impact the most recent depreciation study of equipment and road and track assets.\nTo test the estimated useful lives and salvage values of the Company’s group-life assets, we performed audit\nprocedures that included, among others: obtaining the periodic depreciation studies and annual data reviews\nprovided  by  the  Company’s  third-party  specialist;  assessing  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of  the  data\nprovided by management to the third-party specialist; and including a specialist on our team to evaluate the\nmethods used by the third-party specialist and management in determining the average service lives and\nsalvage values of assets to perform the depreciation studies and any changes to the service lives and salvage\nvalues, if any, resulting from the annual data reviews.\nWe compared the significant methods used by management to those used throughout the industry and within\nother depreciation studies. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates via retrospective\nreview and independently calculated the current year depreciation rates.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1981.\nJacksonville, Florida\nFebruary 16, 2022\nCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.50","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1786,"to":1830}}}}],["9d18e312-03d4-4697-bc9a-4625ae0a6f2a",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nItem 8.

The\nCompany’s merchandise business is comprised of shipments in the following diverse markets: chemicals, agricultural\nand food products, minerals, automotive, forest products, metals and equipment, and fertilizers.\n•The intermodal business shipped 3.0 million units (48% of volume) and generated 16% of revenue in 2021. The\nintermodal business combines the superior economics of rail transportation with the flexibility of trucks and offers a\ncost and environmental advantage over long-haul trucking. Through a network of approximately 30 terminals, the\nintermodal  business  serves  all  major  markets  east  of  the  Mississippi  River  and  transports  mainly  manufactured\nconsumer goods in containers, providing customers with truck-like service for longer shipments.\n•The coal business shipped 706 thousand carloads (11% of volume) and generated 14% of revenue in 2021. The\nCompany transports domestic coal, coke and iron ore to electricity-generating power plants, steel manufacturers and\nindustrial plants as well as export coal to deep-water port facilities. Approximately one-quarter of export coal and the\nmajority of the domestic coal that the Company transports is used for generating electricity or industrial purposes.\n•The trucking business generated 3% of revenue in 2021. Trucking revenue includes revenue from the operations of\nQuality Carriers, which was acquired by CSX effective July 1, 2021.\nOther revenue accounted for 7% of the Company’s total revenue in 2021. This category includes revenue from regional\nsubsidiary  railroads  and  incidental  charges,  including  intermodal  storage  and  equipment  usage,  demurrage  and  switching.\nRevenue  from  regional  subsidiary  railroads  includes  shipments  by  railroads  that  the  Company  does  not  directly  operate.\nIntermodal storage represents charges for customer storage of containers at an intermodal terminal, ramp facility or offsite\nlocation beyond a specified period of time. Demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held by a customer\nbeyond a specified period of time. Switching represents charges assessed when a railroad switches cars for a customer or\nanother railroad.\nEmployees\nThe Company's number of employees was more than 20,900 as of December 2021, which includes approximately\n16,500 union employees.

In addition, management has evaluated and disclosed all material events occurring subsequent\nto the date of the financial statements up to the date this annual report is filed on Form 10-K.\nCommon Stock Split\nOn June 4, 2021, CSX announced a three-for-one split of the Company’s common stock in the form of a stock dividend.\nEach shareholder of record on June 18, 2021, received two additional shares of common stock for each share held as of this\nrecord date. The new shares were distributed after close of trading on June 28, 2021. All prior period share and per share\namounts, common stock, other capital, and retained earnings presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the\nimpact of the stock split. Proportional adjustments were also made to outstanding awards under the Company's stock-based\ncompensation plans.\nUse of Estimates\n    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nrequires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of certain revenues and expenses during\nthe reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Critical accounting estimates using management judgment\nare made for the following areas:\n•personal injury and environmental reserves (see Note 5, Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves);\n•pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting (see Note 9, Employee Benefit Plans);\n•depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method (see Note 6, Properties); and\n•goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets  (see  Note  17, Business  Combinations and  Note  18, Goodwill  and  Other\nIntangibles - Net).\nFiscal Year\nThe Company's fiscal periods are based upon the calendar year.

These  investments  are  carried  at  cost,  which\napproximates market value, and are classified as cash equivalents.\nInvestments\nInvestments in instruments with original maturities greater than three months that will mature in less than one year are\nclassified as short-term investments.

As the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\")\nwill no longer be available beginning July 2023, this standard update provides practical expedients for contract modifications\nmade as part of the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates. CSX's revolving line of credit currently uses LIBOR as a\nreference rate. This standard update can be adopted prospectively through December 31, 2022. The Company continues to\nevaluate the impact of this standard update, but does not anticipate that adoption will have a material impact on the Company's\nresults of operations or financial position.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Disclosure by Business Entities about Government Assistance. This\nstandard update requires annual disclosure of the nature of any government assistance received, accounting policies related to\nsuch assistance and the effect of that assistance on the entity’s financial statements. The Company is required to adopt this\nguidance effective January 2022, though early adoption is permitted.

This  analysis  is  performed  by  the  actuary  and  reviewed  by\nmanagement quarterly. Previously, the quarterly analysis was performed by management. There were no material adjustments\nto the occupational reserve in 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nEnvironmental\nEnvironmental reserves were $108 million and $76 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Environmental reserves as of\nDecember 31, 2021, include liabilities assumed as a result of the Company's acquisition of Quality Carriers. The Company is a\nparty to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings involving private\nparties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party at approximately 220\nenvironmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive\nEnvironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\"), also known as the Superfund Law, or similar\nstate statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued\nrailroad operations. A number of these proceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors,\nsent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the\nCompany’s  land  holdings  were  leased  to  others  for  commercial  or  industrial  uses  that  may  have  resulted  in  releases  of\nhazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company.\nIn  any  such  proceedings,  the  Company  is  subject  to  environmental  clean-up  and  enforcement  actions  under  the\nSuperfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on\ncurrent and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could\nbe substantial.\nCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.70","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":2579,"to":2607}}}}],["02806e58-847f-41a0-838e-8f6be7ffe70e",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nItem 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nNOTE 6.  Properties, continued\nCapital Expenditures\nThe  Company’s  capital  investment  includes  purchased  and  self-constructed  assets  and  property  additions  that\nsubstantially extend the service life or increase the utility of those assets. Indirect costs that can be specifically traced to capital\nprojects are also capitalized. The Company is committed to maintaining and improving its existing infrastructure and expanding\nits network capacity for long-term growth. Rail operations are capital intensive and CSX accounts for these costs in accordance\nwith GAAP and the Company’s capitalization policy. All properties are stated at historical cost less an allowance for accumulated\ndepreciation.\n    The Company’s largest category of capital investment is the replacement of track assets and the acquisition or construction of\nnew assets that enable CSX to enhance its operations or provide new capacity offerings to its customers. These construction\nprojects  are  primarily  completed  by  CSXT  employees. Costs  for  track  asset  replacement  and  capacity  projects  that  are\ncapitalized include:\n•labor costs, because many of the assets are self-constructed;\n•costs to purchase or construct new track or to prepare ground for the laying of track;\n•welding (rail, field and plant), which are processes used to connect segments of rail;\n•new ballast, which is gravel and crushed stone that holds track in line;\n•fuels and lubricants associated with tie, rail and surfacing work, which is the process of raising track to a designated\nelevation over an extended distance;\n•cross, switch and bridge ties, which are the braces that support the rails on a track;\n•gauging, which is the process of standardizing the distance between rails;\n•handling costs associated with installing rail, ties or ballast;\n•usage charge of machinery and equipment utilized in construction or installation; and\n•other track materials.\nLabor is a significant cost in self-constructed track replacement work. CSXT engineering employees directly charge their\nlabor to the track replacement project (the capitalized depreciable property). In replacing track, these employees concurrently\nperform deconstruction and installation of track material. Because of this concurrent process, CSX must estimate the amount of\nlabor that is related to deconstruction versus installation. As a component of the depreciation study for road and track assets,\nmanagement performs an analysis of labor costs related to the self-constructed track replacement work, which includes direct\nobservation of track replacement processes. Through this analysis, CSX determined that approximately 20% of labor costs\nassociated with track replacement is related to the deconstruction of old track, for which certain elements are expensed, and\n80% is associated with the installation of new track, which is capitalized.\n    Capital investment related to locomotives and freight cars comprises the second largest category of the Company’s capital\nassets.  This  category  includes  purchases  of  locomotives  and  freight  cars  as  well  as  certain  equipment  leases  that  are\nconsidered to be finance leases in accordance with the Leases Topic in the ASC. In addition, costs to modify or rebuild these\nassets are capitalized if the investment incurred extends the asset’s service life or improves utilization. Improvement projects\nmust meet specified dollar thresholds to be capitalized and are reviewed by management to determine proper accounting\ntreatment. Routine repairs, overhauls and other maintenance costs, for all asset categories, are expensed as incurred.\nCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.74","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":2721,"to":2761}}}}],["25f30b92-13b9-4aff-b75a-566bd196a2be",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nNOTE 6.  Properties, continued\nDepreciation Method\nThe depreciable assets of the Company are depreciated using either the group-life or straight-line method of accounting,\nwhich are both acceptable depreciation methods in accordance with GAAP. The Company depreciates its railroad assets,\nincluding main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method. Assets depreciated under the group-life\nmethod comprise 86% of total fixed assets of $46.5 billion on a gross basis as of December 2021. The remaining depreciable\nassets of the Company, including non-railroad assets and assets under finance leases, are depreciated using the straight-line\nmethod on a per asset basis. Land is not depreciated.\n    The group-life method aggregates assets with similar lives and characteristics into groups and depreciates each of these\ngroups as a whole. When using the group-life method, an underlying assumption is that each group of assets, as a whole, is\nused and depreciated to the end of its group’s recoverable life. The Company currently utilizes different depreciable asset\ncategories to account for depreciation expense for the railroad assets that are depreciated under the group-life method. By\nutilizing various depreciable categories, the Company can more accurately account for the use of its assets.  All assets of the\nCompany are depreciated on a time or life basis.\nThe group-life method of depreciation closely approximates the straight-line method of depreciation. Additionally, due to\nthe nature of most of its assets (e.g. track is one contiguous, connected asset), the Company believes that this is the most\naccurate and effective way to properly depreciate its assets.\nEstimated Useful Life\n    Management performs a review of depreciation expense and useful lives on a regular basis. Under the group-life method, the\nservice lives and salvage values for each group of assets are determined by completing periodic depreciation studies and\napplying management’s methods to determine the service lives of its properties. A depreciation study is the periodic review of\nasset service lives, salvage values, accumulated depreciation, and other related factors for group assets conducted by a third-\nparty specialist, analyzed by the Company’s management and approved by the STB, the regulatory board that has broad\njurisdiction over railroad practices. The STB requires depreciation studies be performed every three years for equipment assets\n(e.g.,  locomotives  and  freight  cars)  and  every  six  years  for  road  and  track  assets  (e.g.,  bridges,  signals,  rail,  ties,  and\nballast). The Company believes the frequency of depreciation studies currently required by the STB, complemented by annual\ndata reviews conducted by a third-party specialist and analyzed by the Company's management, provides adequate review of\nasset service lives and that a more frequent review would not result in a material change due to the long-lived nature of most of\nthe assets.\n    The Company completed a depreciation study for its road and track assets in 2020 and for equipment assets in 2019, both of\nwhich resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation, service lives, salvage values, and other related factors for certain\nassets. Recent experience with depreciation studies has resulted in changes to accumulated depreciation and depreciation rates\nthat did not materially affect the Company's depreciation expense of $1.4 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for 2021, 2020 and\n2019, respectively.\n    \nCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.75","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":2763,"to":2801}}}}],["a58eed5f-cfa5-428d-8dd5-7f3d3b787f3a",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nNOTE 6.  Properties, continued\nGroup-Life Assets Sales and Retirements\nSince the rail network is one contiguous, connected network it is impractical to maintain specific identification records for\nthese  assets.  For  track  assets  (e.g.,  rail,  ties,  and  ballast),  CSX  utilizes  a  first-in,  first-out  approach  to  asset  retirements.\nEquipment assets (e.g., locomotives and freight cars) are specifically identified at retirement. When an equipment asset is retired\nthat has been depreciated using the group-life method, the cost is reduced from the cost base and recorded in accumulated\ndepreciation.\n    For sales or retirements of assets depreciated under the group-life method that occur in the ordinary course of business, the\nasset cost (net of salvage value or sales proceeds) is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is immediately\nrecognized.  This  practice  is  consistent  with  accounting  treatment  prescribed  under  the  group-life  method.  As  part  of  the\ndepreciation study, an assessment of the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is made to determine if it is deficient (or\nin excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess), including any deferred gains or\nlosses, is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the asset group until the next\nrequired depreciation study. Since the overall assumption with the group-life method is that the assets within the group on\naverage have the same service life and characteristics, it is therefore concluded that the deferred gains and losses offset over\ntime.\nFor sales or retirements of assets depreciated under the group-life method that do not occur in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, a gain or loss may be recognized if the sale or retirement meets each of the following three criteria: (i) it is unusual, (ii)\nit is material in amount, and (iii) it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies. No\nmaterial gains or losses were recognized on the sale of assets depreciated using the group-life method in 2021, 2020 or 2019,\nas no sales met the criteria described above.\nLand and Straight-line Assets Sales and Retirements\n    When the Company sells or retires land, land-related easements or assets depreciated under the straight-line method, a gain\nor loss is recognized in purchased services and other on the consolidated statements of income. Primarily as a result of its\ninitiative to monetize non-core properties, the Company recognized gains on the sale of properties of $454 million, $35 million\nand $151 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSale of Property Rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three CSX-\nowned line segments to the Commonwealth of Virginia (“Commonwealth”) over three phases for a total of $525 million. The\ntiming and amount of gains recognized are based on the allocation of fair value to each conveyance, the timing of future\nconveyances  and  collectability.  In  April  2021,  upon  closing  of  the  first  phase  of  the  agreement,  the  Company  collected\n$200 million in proceeds and recognized a $349 million gain. In fourth quarter 2021, the Company collected additional proceeds\nof $200 million, a portion of which was attributable to the first phase with the remaining attributable to the second phase. There\nwas no gain recognized in fourth quarter 2021 related to this agreement. As the second phase closed on January 10, 2022, the\nresulting $20 million gain will be recognized in first quarter 2022.\nThe Company anticipates closing on the remaining conveyances by the end of 2022, which will result in future cash\nproceeds and gains.

Initial assessments of recoverability are based on estimates of\nundiscounted future net cash flows associated with an asset or a group of assets in accordance with the Property, Plant, and\nEquipment Topic in the ASC. Where impairment is indicated, the assets are evaluated and their carrying amount is reduced to\nfair value based on discounted net cash flows or other estimates of fair value.

In 2019, impairment expense of $22\nmillion was related to an intermodal terminal sale agreement. Impairment expense is recorded in purchased services and other\nexpense on the consolidated income statement.\nNOTE 7. Leases\n    At inception, the Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease and whether that lease meets the classification\ncriteria of a finance or operating lease. Some of the Company’s lease arrangements contain lease components (e.g., minimum\nrent payments) and non-lease components (e.g., maintenance, labor charges, etc.). The Company generally accounts for each\ncomponent separately based on the estimated standalone price of each component. For certain equipment leases, such as\nfreight car, vehicles and work equipment, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease\ncomponent.\nCertain of the Company’s lease agreements include rental payments that are adjusted periodically for an index or rate.\nThe leases are initially measured using the projected payments adjusted for the index or rate in effect at the commencement\ndate. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nOperating Leases\nOperating leases are included in right-of-use lease assets, other current liabilities and long-term lease liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. These assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value\nof remaining lease payments over the lease term using the Company’s secured incremental borrowing rates or implicit rates,\nwhen readily determinable. Short-term operating leases, which have an initial term of 12 months or less, are not recorded on the\nbalance sheet.\nThe Company has various lease agreements with other parties with terms up to 50 years. Non-cancelable, long-term\nleases may include provisions for maintenance, options to purchase and options to extend the terms. These options are included\nin the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense for operating leases, including\nleases with escalations over their terms, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease expense is\nrecognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Lease expense is included in equipment and\nother rents on the consolidated income statements and is reported net of lease income. Lease income was not material to the\nresults of operations for 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.77","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":2847,"to":2883}}}}],["bbb4ed5c-d08f-44a8-a04b-1ef2d3cbb64f",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nItem 8.

For third-party liability claims, the Company retains all\nrisk up to $100 million per occurrence.

Some of the\nlegal proceedings include claims for compensatory as well as punitive damages and others are, or are purported to be, class\nactions.

Accordingly, the Company's estimate will change from time to time, and\nactual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate.\nFuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation\nIn May 2007, class action lawsuits were filed against CSXT and three other U.S.-based Class I railroads alleging that the\ndefendants' fuel surcharge practices relating to contract and unregulated traffic resulted from an illegal conspiracy in violation of\nantitrust laws. The class action lawsuits were consolidated into one case in federal court in the District of Columbia. In 2017, the\nDistrict Court issued its decision denying class certification. On August 16, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit\naffirmed the District Court’s ruling.\n    The consolidated case is now moving forward without class certification. Although a class was not certified, shippers other\nthan those who brought the original lawsuit in 2007 must decide whether to bring their own individual claim against one or more\nrailroads. Individual shipper claims filed to date have been consolidated into a separate case.\n    CSXT believes that its fuel surcharge practices were arrived at and applied lawfully and that the case is without merit.\nAccordingly, the Company intends to defend itself vigorously.

The Company’s performance obligation arises when it\nreceives a bill of lading (“BOL”) to transport a customer's commodities at a negotiated price contained in a transportation\nservices agreement or a publicly disclosed tariff rate. Once a BOL is received, a contract is formed whereby the parties are\ncommitted to perform, collectability of consideration is probable and the rights of the parties, shipping terms and conditions, and\npayment terms are identified. A customer may submit several BOLs for transportation services at various times throughout a\nservice agreement term, but each shipment represents a distinct service that is a separately identified performance obligation.\n(a)\n(a)\n(b)\nCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.93","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":3435,"to":3472}}}}],["340c282d-60e9-47ad-a171-cbedd7249667",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nNOTE 11. Revenues, continued\nThe  average  transit  time  to  complete  a  rail  shipment  is  between  2  to  8  days  depending  on  market.  Payments  for\ntransportation services are normally billed once a BOL is received and are generally due within 15 days after the invoice date.\nThe Company recognizes revenue over transit time of freight as it moves from origin to destination. Revenue for services started\nbut not completed at the reporting date is allocated based on the relative transit time in each reporting period, with the portion\nallocated for services subsequent to the reporting date considered remaining performance obligations.\nThe certain key estimates included in the recognition and measurement of revenue and related accounts receivable are\nas follows:\n•Revenue associated with shipments in transit is recognized ratably over transit time and is based on average cycle times\nto move commodities and products from their origin to their final destination or interchange;\n•Adjustments to revenue for billing corrections and billing discounts;\n•Adjustments to revenue for overcharge claims filed by customers, which are based on historical payments to customers\nfor rate overcharges as a percentage of total billing; and\n•Incentive-based refunds to customers, which are primarily volume-related, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on the\nbasis of the projected liability (this estimate is based on historical activity, current volume levels and forecasted future\nvolume).\nRevenue related to interline transportation services that involve the services of another party, such as another railroad, is\nreported on a net basis. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to another party is\nnot reflected as revenue.\nEffective third quarter 2021, trucking revenue includes revenue from the operations of Quality Carriers and is mostly\ncomprised of truck shipments of chemicals. A performance obligation arises when Quality Carriers receives a customer order to\ntransport a commodity at a contracted rate. Revenue is recorded on a gross basis ratably over transit time.\nOther revenue is recorded upon completion of the service and is comprised of revenue from regional subsidiary railroads\nand incidental charges, including intermodal storage and equipment usage, demurrage and switching. Revenue from regional\nsubsidiary railroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Intermodal storage represents\ncharges for customer storage of containers at an intermodal terminal, ramp facility or offsite location beyond a specified period of\ntime. Demurrage represents charges assessed when freight cars are held by a customer beyond a specified period of time.\nSwitching represents charges assessed when a railroad switches cars for a customer or another railroad.\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due\nto changes in transaction price) was not material.\nCSX 2021 Form 10-K p.94","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":3474,"to":3507}}}}],["b0fd0cc5-99c7-40e8-afec-58746857be38",{"pageContent":"CSX CORPORATION\nPART II\nItem 8.

For CSX, this statement applies to certain investments, pension plan assets, long-term debt and\ninterest rate derivatives. Also, the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic in the ASC clarifies the definition of fair value\nfor financial reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair\nvalue measurements.   \nVarious inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company's investments, pension plan assets, long-term\ndebt and interest rate derivatives. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the\nrisk associated with investing in these securities. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below:\n•Level  1  –  observable  market  inputs  that  are  unadjusted  quoted  prices  for  identical  assets  or  liabilities  in  active\nmarkets;\n•Level 2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk,\netc.); and\n•Level 3 – significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market\nparticipants would use in determining the fair value of investments).\nThe valuation methods described below may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable\nvalue or reflective of future fair values.

The majority of the\nCompany's long-term debt is valued with assistance from a third party that utilizes closing transactions, market quotes or market\nvalues of comparable debt. For those instruments not valued by the third party, the fair value has been estimated by applying\nmarket rates of similar instruments to the scheduled contractual debt payments and maturities. These market rates are provided\nby the same third party.  All of the inputs used to determine the fair value of the Company's long-term debt are Level 2 inputs.\nThe fair value of outstanding debt fluctuates with changes in a number of factors.

These assets are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\n•Cash and cash equivalents (Level 1):  Includes cash and short term investments with an original maturity of three months\nor less. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents at year end approximates fair value. These assets are classified\nin Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\n•Corporate  bonds,  government  securities,  asset-backed  securities  and  derivatives  (Level  2):  Valued  using  price\nevaluations reflecting the bid and/or ask sides of the market for a similar investment at year end.

We encourage you to read CSX’s amended\nand restated articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as applicable provisions of the VSCA, for more information.\nAuthorized Capital Stock\nThe authorized capital stock of CSX is (i) 5,400,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, and (ii) 25,000,000\nshares of preferred stock, without par value, issuable in series.\nCommon Stock\nListing. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “CSX.”\nFully Paid and Non-Assessable. All outstanding shares of common stock are fully-paid and non-assessable. Any additional\nshares of common stock we issue will also be fully-paid and non-assessable.\nVoting Rights. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters voted on by shareholders, and, except\nas otherwise required by law or provided by the terms of any series of preferred stock, the holders of those shares exclusively\npossess all voting power of CSX. No holder of common stock is entitled as such, as a matter of right, to subscribe for or\npurchase any shares of common stock or preferred stock. There is no cumulative voting in the election of directors, who are\nelected annually by a vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to a nominee’s election; provided, that if there are more\nnominees for election than the number of directors to be elected, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast in such an\nelection.\nDividends. Subject to the preferential rights of any outstanding series of preferred stock, the holders of common stock are\nentitled to receive ratably dividends as may be declared from time to time by our Board of Directors from funds legally available\nfor that purpose.\nRight to Receive Liquidation Distributions. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of CSX, holders of common\nstock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment or provision for liabilities and amounts owing in respect\nof any outstanding preferred stock.\nTransfer Agent.

No\nholder of preferred stock will be entitled, as a matter of right, to subscribe for or purchase any shares of preferred stock or\ncommon stock.\nUnless otherwise determined by our Board of Directors, any series of preferred stock will rank, with respect to dividends and the\ndistribution of assets, senior to common stock, and on a parity with shares of any other then outstanding series of preferred\nstock.

In addition, under certain circumstances, preferred stock could also restrict dividend payments to our\nholders of common stock.\nVirginia Stock Corporation Act; Anti-takeover Effects\nThe VSCA contains provisions governing “Affiliated Transactions.” These provisions, with several exceptions discussed below,\ngenerally require approval of certain material transactions between a Virginia corporation and any beneficial holder of more than\n10% of any class of its outstanding voting shares (an “Interested Shareholder”) by a majority of disinterested directors and by the\nholders of at least two-thirds of the remaining voting shares. Affiliated Transactions subject to this approval requirement include\nmergers, share exchanges, material dispositions of corporate assets not in the ordinary course of business, any dissolution of\nthe corporation proposed by or on behalf of an Interested Shareholder, or any reclassification, including a reverse stock split,\nrecapitalization or merger of the corporation with its subsidiaries, which increases the percentage of voting shares owned\nbeneficially by an Interested Shareholder by more than 5%.","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":4547,"to":4579}}}}],["086f3522-5a47-4be6-83e2-f206b20c4c86",{"pageContent":"For three years following the time that a person becomes an Interested Shareholder, a Virginia corporation cannot engage in an\nAffiliated Transaction with that Interested Shareholder without the approval of two-thirds of the voting shares other than those\nshares  beneficially  owned  by  the  Interested  Shareholder,  and  the  approval  of  a  majority  of  the  Disinterested  Directors.\n“Disinterested Director” means, with respect to a particular Interested Shareholder, a member of our Board of Directors who\nwas:\n•a member before the date on which an Interested Shareholder became an Interested Shareholder, or\n•recommended for election by, or was elected to fill a vacancy and received the affirmative vote of, a majority of the\nDisinterested Directors then on the Board of Directors.\nAfter the expiration of the three-year period, the statute requires approval of Affiliated Transactions by two-thirds of the voting\nshares other than those beneficially owned by the Interested Shareholder.\nThe principal exceptions to the special voting requirements apply to transactions proposed after the three-year period has\nexpired and require either that the transaction be approved by a majority of CSX’s Disinterested Directors or that the transaction\nsatisfy the fair-price requirements of the statute. In general, the fair-price requirement provides that in a two-step acquisition\ntransaction, the Interested Shareholder must pay the shareholders in the second step either the same amount of cash or the\nsame amount and type of consideration paid to acquire CSX’s shares in the first step.\nNone of the limitations and special voting requirements described above applies to an Interested Shareholder whose acquisition\nof shares making that person an Interested Shareholder was approved by a majority of CSX’s Disinterested Directors.\nThese  provisions  are  designed  to  deter  certain  types  of  takeovers  of  Virginia  corporations.  The  statute  provides  that,  by\naffirmative vote of a majority of the voting shares other than shares owned by any Interested Shareholder, a corporation can\nadopt an amendment to its articles of incorporation or bylaws providing that the Affiliated Transactions provisions will not apply\nto the corporation. At the 2006 annual meeting, the shareholders of CSX voted to “opt out” of the Affiliated Transactions\nprovisions of the VSCA. Under CSX’s amended and restated articles of incorporation, the following actions must be approved by\nthe affirmative vote of a majority of the voting shares entitled to vote: (1) any plan of merger or share exchange for which the\nVSCA requires shareholder approval; (2) the sale of all or substantially all of CSX’s property for which the VSCA requires\nshareholder approval; and (3) the dissolution of CSX. Majority voting for these three types of actions became effective on\nNovember 3, 2007, 18 months after the amendment was approved by the shareholders.\nThe VSCA also generally provides that shares of a Virginia corporation acquired in a transaction that would cause the acquiring\nperson’s voting strength to meet or exceed any of three thresholds (20%, 33-1/3% or 50%) have no voting rights with respect to\nthose shares unless granted by a majority vote of shares not owned by the acquiring person or any officer or employee-director\nof the corporation. This provision empowers an acquiring person to require the Virginia corporation to hold a special meeting of\nshareholders  to  consider  the  matter  within  50  days  of  its  request.  CSX’s  bylaws  provide  that  this  law  does  not  apply  to\nacquisitions of CSX stock.","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/c10cb1ed-c367-4ade-b1c4-57ff40c9b069.pdf","pdf_numpages":129,"loc":{"lines":{"from":4581,"to":4612}}}}],["de662716-abb4-4119-a2c2-22125e581d6c",{"pageContent":"Exhibit 21\n \nSubsidiaries of the Registrant\n \nAs of December 31, 2021, the Registrant was the beneficial owner of 100% of the common stock of the following significant\nsubsidiaries:\n \nCSX Transportation, Inc.

Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies\nBackground\nCSX Corporation together with its subsidiaries (\"CSX\" or the “Company”), based in Jacksonville, Florida, is one of the nation's\nleading transportation companies. The Company provides rail-based transportation services including traditional rail service, the transport\nof intermodal containers and trailers, as well as other transportation services such as rail-to-truck transfers and bulk commodity operations.\n    CSX's principal operating subsidiary, CSX Transportation, Inc. (“CSXT”), provides an important link to the transportation supply chain\nthrough its approximately 20,000 route mile rail network and serves major population centers in 26 states east of the Mississippi River, the\nDistrict of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The Company's intermodal business links customers to railroads\nvia trucks and terminals. On June 1, 2022, CSX completed its acquisition of Pan Am Systems, Inc. (“Pan Am”) which is the parent\ncompany of Pan Am Railways, Inc. This acquisition expands CSXT’s reach in the Northeastern United States.\nCSXT is also responsible for the Company's real estate sales, leasing, acquisition and management and development activities.\nSubstantially all of these activities are focused on supporting railroad operations.\nOther entities\n    In addition to CSXT, the Company’s subsidiaries include Quality Carriers, Inc. (\"Quality Carriers\"), CSX Intermodal Terminals, Inc. (“CSX\nIntermodal Terminals”), Total Distribution Services, Inc. (“TDSI”), Transflo Terminal Services, Inc. (“Transflo”), CSX Technology, Inc. (“CSX\nTechnology”) and other subsidiaries. Quality Carriers is the largest provider of bulk liquid chemicals truck transportation in North America.\nCSX Intermodal Terminals owns and operates a system of intermodal terminals, predominantly in the eastern United States and also\nperforms drayage services (the pickup and delivery of intermodal shipments) for certain customers. TDSI serves the automotive industry\nwith distribution centers and storage locations. Transflo connects non-rail served customers to the many benefits of rail by transferring\nproducts from rail to trucks. The biggest Transflo markets are chemicals and agriculture, which includes shipments of plastics and ethanol.\nCSX Technology and other subsidiaries provide support services for the Company.\nSale of Property Rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three CSX-owned line\nsegments to the Commonwealth of Virginia (“Commonwealth”) over three phases for a total of $525 million. The timing and amount of\ngains recognized are based on the allocation of fair value to each conveyance, the timing of future conveyances and collectability. In April\n2021, upon closing of the first phase of the agreement, the Company collected $200 million in proceeds and recognized a $349 million\ngain. In fourth quarter 2021, the Company collected additional proceeds of $200 million, a portion of which was attributable to the first\nphase with the remainder attributable to the second phase. The second phase closed in January 2022, which resulted in a $20 million gain\nin first quarter 2022. During June 2022, the final $125 million of proceeds was approved by the Commonwealth, which resulted in a\n$122 million gain in second quarter 2022 related to property rights previously conveyed. To date, total proceeds of $400 million have been\ncollected and total gains of $491 million have been recognized.\nCSX Q3 2022 Form 10-Q p.8","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/e2dbc170-f9a6-417d-8833-aa1b7da9450e.pdf","pdf_numpages":94,"loc":{"lines":{"from":338,"to":373}}}}],["85092129-12ac-481f-972d-45dd636a19c5",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 1.

Where applicable, prior year information has\nbeen reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(“SEC”), certain information and disclosures normally included in the notes to the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) have been omitted from these interim financial statements. CSX suggests that\nthese financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes included in CSX's most recent annual\nreport on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed current reports on Form 8-K.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company's fiscal periods are based upon the calendar year. Except as otherwise specified, references to “third quarter(s)” or\n“nine months” indicate CSX's fiscal periods ending September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, and references to \"year-end\" indicate\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn  March  2020,  the  Financial Accounting  Standards  Board  (\"FASB\")  issued Accounting  Standards  Update  (\"ASU\")  2020-04,\nFacilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. As the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") will no longer\nbe available beginning July 2023, this standard update provides practical expedients for contract modifications made as part of the\ntransition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates. CSX's revolving line of credit currently uses LIBOR as a reference rate. This standard\nupdate can be adopted prospectively through December 31, 2022. The Company does not anticipate that adoption will have a material\nimpact on the Company's results of operations or financial position.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Disclosure by Business Entities about Government Assistance. This standard\nupdate requires annual disclosure of the nature of any government assistance received, accounting policies related to such assistance and\nthe effect of that assistance on the entity’s financial statements. The Company will adopt this guidance effective year end 2022 and the\nstandard update will not impact the Company's results of operations or financial position as the update only impacts disclosures.\nCSX Q3 2022 Form 10-Q p.9","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/e2dbc170-f9a6-417d-8833-aa1b7da9450e.pdf","pdf_numpages":94,"loc":{"lines":{"from":375,"to":411}}}}],["04e67eb4-fe7f-48ce-b4a2-cc62ae233a40",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 2.

The average\nannual operating income growth percentage and CCE measures over the plan period will each comprise 50% of the payout and will be\nmeasured independently of the other. As defined under the plan, CCE is a cash-flow based measure that incentivizes strategic investments\nearning more than the required return. CCE equals CSX’s gross cash earnings (after-tax EBITDA) minus the required return on gross\noperating assets.\n    Grants were made in performance units, with each unit representing the right to receive one share of CSX common stock, and payouts\nwill be made in CSX common stock. The payout range for participants will be between 0% and 200% of the target awards depending on\nCompany performance against predetermined goals. Payouts for certain executive officers are subject to formulaic upward or downward\nadjustment by up to 25%, capped at an overall payout of 250%, based upon the Company's total shareholder return relative to specified\ncomparable groups over the performance period. Participants will receive stock dividend equivalents declared over the performance period\nbased on the number of performance units paid upon vesting. Other immaterial grants of performance units were made during third\nquarters 2022 and 2021. The fair values of the performance units awarded during the third quarters and nine months 2022 and 2021 were\nprimarily calculated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model with the following weighted-average assumptions:\nThird QuartersNine Months\n2022202120222021\nWeighted-Average Assumptions Used:\nRisk-free Interest Rate4.3 %N/A2.3 %0.2 %\nAnnualized Volatility33.2 %N/A33.0 %33.6 %\nExpected Life (in years)2.3N/A2.72.9\nStock Options\nIn February 2022, the Company granted approximately 1.6 million stock options along with the corresponding LTIP. The fair value of\nstock options was calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. These stock options were granted with ten-year terms and vest\nover three years in equal installments each year on the anniversary of the grant date. The exercise price for stock options granted equals\nthe closing market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.

Considering the\nlegal defenses currently available, the liabilities that have been recorded and other factors, it is the opinion of management that none of\nthese  items  individually,  when  finally  resolved,  will  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's  financial  condition,  results  of\noperations or liquidity. Should a number of these items occur in the same period, however, their combined effect could be material in that\nparticular period.\nCasualty\n     Casualty reserves of $190 million and $180 million as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, represent accruals\nfor personal injury, occupational disease and occupational injury claims primarily related to railroad operations. Beginning June 1, 2021,\nthe Company's self-insured retention amount for these claims increased from $75 million to $100 million per occurrence. Currently, no\nindividual claim is expected to exceed the self-insured retention amount. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic in the ASC, to the\nextent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, the Company would present the liability on a gross basis\nwith a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. These reserves fluctuate based upon the timing of payments as well as changes\nin estimate. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the number, type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and\nuncertainties in litigation. Most of the Company's casualty claims relate to CSXT. Defense and processing costs, which historically have\nbeen insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities.\nPersonal Injury\n        Personal  injury  reserves  represent  liabilities  for  employee  work-related  and  third-party  injuries.  Work-related  injuries  for  CSXT\nemployees  are  primarily  subject  to  the  Federal  Employers’  Liability  Act  (“FELA”).  CSXT  retains  an  independent  actuary  to  assist\nmanagement in assessing the value of personal injury claims. An analysis is performed by the actuary quarterly and is reviewed by\nmanagement. This analysis did not result in a material adjustment to the personal injury reserve in the quarters and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 or September 30, 2021.

The  Company  retains  an  independent  actuary  to  analyze  the  Company’s  historical  claim  filings,\nsettlement amounts, and dismissal rates to assist in determining future anticipated claim filing rates and average settlement values.

The  Company  has  been  identified  as  a  potentially  responsible  party  at  approximately  230\nenvironmentally impaired sites. Many of these are, or may be, subject to remedial action under the federal Comprehensive Environmental\nResponse, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (\"CERCLA\"), also known as the Superfund Law, or similar state statutes. Most of these\nproceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. A number of these\nproceedings, however, are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or\noperated by others for treatment, recycling or disposal. In addition, some of the Company's land holdings were leased to others for\ncommercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property\nand could give rise to proceedings against the Company.\nIn any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as\nwell as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and\noperators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial.\nIn accordance with the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations Topic in the ASC, the Company reviews its role with\nrespect to each site identified at least quarterly, giving consideration to a number of factors such as:\n•type of clean-up required;\n•nature of the Company's alleged connection to the location (e.g., generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the\nsite);\n•extent of the Company's alleged connection (e.g., volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and\n•number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed potentially responsible parties at the location.\nCSX Q3 2022 Form 10-Q p.16","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/e2dbc170-f9a6-417d-8833-aa1b7da9450e.pdf","pdf_numpages":94,"loc":{"lines":{"from":623,"to":657}}}}],["6a7e8981-1185-486d-bc28-bcb3588b07d2",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 4.    Casualty, Environmental and Other Reserves, continued\n    Based on management's review process, amounts have been recorded to cover contingent anticipated future environmental remediation\ncosts with respect to each site to the extent such costs are reasonably estimable and probable. The recorded liabilities for estimated future\nenvironmental costs are undiscounted. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant\nongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries. Payments related to these liabilities are expected to be made\nover the next several years. Environmental remediation costs are included in purchased services and other on the consolidated income\nstatements.\nCurrently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any,\non some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given\nlocation,  result  in  additional  exposure,  the  amount  and  materiality  of  which  cannot  presently  be  reasonably  estimated.  Based  upon\ninformation currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves accurately reflect the estimated cost of remedial\nactions currently required.\nOther\nOther reserves were $84 million and $80 million as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Other reserves\ninclude liabilities for various claims, such as automobile, property, general liability and workers' compensation. Also included in other\nreserves are longshoremen disability claims related to a previously owned international shipping business (these claims are in runoff) as\nwell as claims for current port employees.\nNOTE 5.    Commitments and Contingencies\nInsurance\n    The Company maintains insurance programs with substantial limits for property damage, including resulting business interruption, and\nthird-party liability. A certain amount of risk is retained by the Company on each insurance program. Under its property insurance program,\nthe Company retains all risk up to $100 million per occurrence for losses from floods and named windstorms and up to $75 million per\noccurrence for other property losses. For third-party liability claims, the Company retains all risk up to $100 million per occurrence. As CSX\nnegotiates insurance coverage above its full self-retention amounts, it retains a percentage of risk at various layers of coverage. While the\nCompany believes its insurance coverage is adequate, future claims could exceed existing insurance coverage or insurance may not\ncontinue to be available at commercially reasonable rates.\nCSX Q3 2022 Form 10-Q p.17","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/e2dbc170-f9a6-417d-8833-aa1b7da9450e.pdf","pdf_numpages":94,"loc":{"lines":{"from":659,"to":689}}}}],["e7a07992-6e80-45bc-b5dd-2a7e79bc4151",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 5.    Commitments and Contingencies, continued\nLegal\n    The Company is involved in litigation incidental to its business and is a party to a number of legal actions and claims, various\ngovernmental proceedings and private civil lawsuits, including, but not limited to, those related to fuel surcharge practices, tax matters,\nenvironmental and hazardous material exposure matters, FELA and labor claims by current or former employees, other personal injury or\nproperty claims and disputes and complaints involving certain transportation rates and charges. Some of the legal proceedings include\nclaims for compensatory as well as punitive damages and others are, or are purported to be, class actions. While the final outcome of\nthese matters cannot be predicted with certainty, considering, among other things, the legal defenses available and liabilities that have\nbeen recorded along with applicable insurance, it is currently the opinion of management that none of these pending items is likely to have\na material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. An unexpected adverse resolution of one\nor more of these items, however, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or\nliquidity in that particular period.\n    The Company is able to estimate a range of possible loss for certain legal proceedings for which a loss is reasonably possible in excess\nof reserves established. The Company has estimated this range to be $3 million to $22 million in aggregate at September 30, 2022. This\nestimated  aggregate  range  is  based  upon  currently  available  information  and  is  subject  to  significant  judgment  and  a  variety  of\nassumptions. Accordingly, the Company's estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current\nestimate.\nFuel Surcharge Antitrust Litigation\n    In May 2007, class action lawsuits were filed against CSXT and three other U.S.-based Class I railroads alleging that the defendants'\nfuel surcharge practices relating to contract and unregulated traffic resulted from an illegal conspiracy in violation of antitrust laws. The\nclass action lawsuits were consolidated into one case in federal court in the District of Columbia. In 2017, the District Court issued its\ndecision denying class certification. On August 16, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed the District Court’s ruling.\nThe consolidated case is now moving forward without class certification. Although the class was not certified, individual shippers\nhave since brought claims against the railroads, which have been consolidated into a separate case.\n    CSXT believes that its fuel surcharge practices were arrived at and applied lawfully and that the case is without merit. Accordingly, the\nCompany intends to defend itself vigorously. However, penalties for violating antitrust laws can be severe, and resolution of these matters\nindividually or when aggregated could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity\nin that particular period.\nCSX Q3 2022 Form 10-Q p.18","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/e2dbc170-f9a6-417d-8833-aa1b7da9450e.pdf","pdf_numpages":94,"loc":{"lines":{"from":691,"to":723}}}}],["26946440-cd8a-4033-9215-e4ff3bdf3ccf",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 5.    Commitments and Contingencies, continued\nEnvironmental\n    CSXT is indemnifying Pharmacia LLC, formerly known as Monsanto Company, (\"Pharmacia\") for certain liabilities associated with real\nestate  located  in  Kearny,  New  Jersey  along  the  Lower  Passaic  River  (the  “Property”). The  Property,  which  was  formerly  owned  by\nPharmacia,  is  now  owned  by  CSXT.  CSXT's  indemnification  and  defense  duties  arise  with  respect  to  several  matters.  The  U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), using its CERCLA authority, seeks the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances in the\n17-mile Lower Passaic River Study Area (the \"Study Area”). CSXT, on behalf of Pharmacia, and a significant number of other potentially\nresponsible parties are together conducting a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study of the Study Area pursuant to an Administrative\nSettlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA. Pharmacia’s share of responsibility, indemnified by CSXT, for the investigation\nand cleanup costs of the Study Area may be determined through various mechanisms including (a) an allocation and settlement with EPA;\n(b) litigation brought by EPA against non-settling parties; or (c) litigation among the responsible parties.\nFor the lower 8 miles of the Study Area, EPA issued its Record of Decision detailing the agency’s mandated remedial process in\nMarch 2016. Approximately 80 parties, including Pharmacia, are participating in an EPA-directed allocation and settlement process to\nassign responsibility for the remedy selected for the lower 8 miles of the Study Area. CSXT is participating in the EPA-directed allocation\nand settlement process on behalf of Pharmacia.\nFor the remainder of the Study Area, EPA has selected an interim remedy in a Record of Decision dated September 28, 2021.\nSettlement discussions are also ongoing for the selected interim remedy. On March 2, 2022, EPA issued a Notice Letter to Pharmacia,\nOccidental  Chemical  Corporation  and  eight  other  parties  alleging  they  are  liable  under  Section  107(a)  of  CERCLA  for  releases  or\nthreatened releases of hazardous substances and requesting each party, individually or collectively, submit good faith offers to EPA in\nconnection with the Study Area. CSX, on behalf of Pharmacia, responded to the Notice Letter and submitted a good faith offer to EPA on\nJune 27, 2022, following meetings with a mediator from EPA’s Conflict Prevention and Resolution Center. Negotiations with EPA and other\nparties to resolve this matter continue.\n    CSXT is also defending and indemnifying Pharmacia with regard to the Property in litigation filed by Occidental Chemical Corporation,\nwhich is seeking to recover various costs. These costs include costs for the remedial design of the lower 8 miles of the Study Area, as well\nas anticipated costs associated with the future remediation of the entire Study Area. Alternatively, Occidental seeks to compel some, or all\nof the defendants to participate in the remediation of the Study Area. Pharmacia is one of approximately 110 defendants in this federal\nlawsuit filed by Occidental on June 30, 2018.\n    CSXT is also defending and indemnifying Pharmacia in a cooperative natural resource damages assessment process related to the\nProperty. Based on currently available information, the Company does not believe its share of remediation costs as determined by the\nEPA-directed allocation with respect to the Property and the Study Area would be material to the Company's financial condition, results of\noperations or liquidity.\nCSX Q3 2022 Form 10-Q p.19","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/e2dbc170-f9a6-417d-8833-aa1b7da9450e.pdf","pdf_numpages":94,"loc":{"lines":{"from":725,"to":760}}}}],["2aaf23d1-e11e-4b5f-95f7-226cee05bcda",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 6.

The Company’s performance obligation arises when it receives a bill of\nlading (“BOL”) to transport a customer's commodities at a negotiated price contained in a transportation services agreement or a publicly\ndisclosed  tariff  rate.  Once  a  BOL  is  received,  a  contract  is  formed  whereby  the  parties  are  committed  to  perform,  collectability  of\nconsideration is probable and the rights of the parties, shipping terms and conditions, and payment terms are identified. A customer may\nsubmit several BOLs for transportation services at various times throughout a service agreement term but each shipment represents a\ndistinct service that is a separately identified performance obligation.\n(a)\nCSX Q3 2022 Form 10-Q p.23","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/e2dbc170-f9a6-417d-8833-aa1b7da9450e.pdf","pdf_numpages":94,"loc":{"lines":{"from":877,"to":913}}}}],["82d08712-5ffa-42b6-a875-aa8772ec482f",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 8.     Revenues, continued\nThe average transit time to complete a rail shipment is between 2 to 8 days depending on market. Payments for transportation\nservices are normally billed once a BOL is received and are generally due within 15 days after the invoice date. The Company recognizes\nrevenue over transit time of freight as it moves from origin to destination. Revenue for services started but not completed at the reporting\ndate is allocated based on the relative transit time in each reporting period, with the portion allocated for services subsequent to the\nreporting date considered remaining performance obligations.\nThe certain key estimates included in the recognition and measurement of revenue and related accounts receivable are as follows:\n•revenue associated with shipments in transit, which is recognized ratably over transit time and is based on average cycle times to\nmove commodities and products from their origin to their final destination or interchange;\n•adjustments to revenue for billing corrections and billing discounts;\n•adjustments to revenue for overcharge claims filed by customers, which are based on historical payments to customers for rate\novercharges as a percentage of total billing; and\n•incentive-based refunds to customers, which are primarily volume-related, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on the basis of\nthe projected liability (this estimate is based on historical activity, current volume levels and forecasted future volume).\nRevenue related to interline transportation services that involve the services of another party, such as another railroad, is reported\non a net basis. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to another party is not reflected as\nrevenue.\nEffective third quarter 2021, trucking revenue includes revenue from the operations of Quality Carriers. This revenue is mostly\ncomprised of truck shipments of chemicals and is recorded ratably over transit time.\nOther revenue is recorded upon completion of the service and is comprised of revenue from regional subsidiary railroads and\nincidental  charges,  including  intermodal  storage  and  equipment  usage,  demurrage  and  switching.  Revenue  from  regional  subsidiary\nrailroads includes shipments by railroads that the Company does not directly operate. Intermodal storage represents charges for customer\nstorage of containers at an intermodal terminal, ramp facility or offsite location beyond a specified period of time. Demurrage represents\ncharges assessed when freight cars are held by a customer beyond a specified period of time. Switching represents charges assessed\nwhen a railroad switches cars for a customer or another railroad.\nCSX Q3 2022 Form 10-Q p.24","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/e2dbc170-f9a6-417d-8833-aa1b7da9450e.pdf","pdf_numpages":94,"loc":{"lines":{"from":915,"to":944}}}}],["3051f04e-4cef-4f65-a7c8-0018db18d6b0",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\nNOTE 8.

Fair Value Measurements\nThe Financial Instruments Topic in the ASC requires disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in annual reports as well\nas in quarterly reports. For CSX, this statement applies to certain investments, long-term debt and interest rate derivatives. Disclosure of\nthe fair value of pension plan assets is only required annually. Also, this rule clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting,\nestablishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements.\nVarious inputs are considered when determining the value of the Company's investments, pension plan assets, long-term debt and\ninterest rate derivatives. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated\nwith investing in these securities. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.\n•Level 1 - observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;\n•Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, credit risk, etc.); and\n•Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Company's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants\nwould use in determining the fair value of investments).\nThe valuation methods described below may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or\nreflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other\nmarket participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could\nresult in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nInvestments\n    The Company's investment assets are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with the Fair Value\nMeasurements and Disclosures Topic in the ASC. They are valued with assistance from a third-party trustee and consist of fixed income\nmutual funds, corporate bonds and government securities. The fixed income mutual funds are valued at the net asset value of shares held\nbased on quoted market prices determined in an active market, which are Level 1 inputs. The corporate bonds and government securities\nare valued using broker quotes that utilize observable market inputs, which are Level 2 inputs.

The majority of the Company's long-term debt is valued with assistance from\na third party that utilizes closing transactions, market quotes or market values of comparable debt. For those instruments not valued by the\nthird party, the fair value has been estimated by applying market rates of similar instruments to the scheduled contractual debt payments\nand maturities. These market rates are provided by the same third party. All of the inputs used to determine the fair value of the Company's\nlong-term debt are Level 2 inputs.\nThe fair value of outstanding debt fluctuates with changes in a number of factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to,\ninterest rates, market conditions, credit ratings, values of similar financial instruments, size of the transaction, cash flow projections and\ncomparable trades. Fair value will exceed carrying value when the current market interest rate is lower than the interest rate at which the\ndebt was originally issued. The fair value of a company's debt is a measure of its current value under present market conditions. It does not\nimpact the financial statements under current accounting rules.

Total comprehensive earnings are defined as all changes in shareholders' equity during a period, other\nthan those resulting from investments by and distributions to shareholders (e.g. issuance of equity securities and dividends). Generally, for\nCSX, total comprehensive earnings equal net earnings plus or minus adjustments for pension and other post-retirement liabilities as well\nas derivative activity and other adjustments.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-GAAP Measures - Unaudited\n    CSX reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S.\nGAAP). CSX also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G\nand Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior\nreported results.  Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s non-\nGAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP\nmeasures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance\nwith GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are below.\nFree Cash Flow\n    Management believes that free cash flow is supplemental information useful to investors as it is important in evaluating the Company’s\nfinancial performance. More specifically, free cash flow measures cash generated by the business after reinvestment. This measure\nrepresents cash available for both equity and bond investors to be used for dividends, share repurchases or principal reduction on\noutstanding debt. Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions and proceeds and\nadvances from property dispositions. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by\noperating activities. The decrease in free cash flow before dividends from the prior year of $27 million is due to a decrease in proceeds\nfrom property dispositions and higher property additions, partially offset by an increase in cash from operating activities.\n    The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow, before dividends (non-GAAP\nmeasure). \nNine Months\n(Dollars in millions)\n20222021\nNet cash provided by operating activities$4,255 $3,819 \nProperty Additions(1,437)(1,220)\nProceeds and Advances from Property Dispositions51 297 \nOther Investing Activities \nn/a— \nFree Cash Flow (before payment of dividends)\n$2,869 $2,896 \n(a) Effective first quarter 2022, the results of other investing activities are no longer included in free cash flow.

Training  and  safety  programs  are  designed  to  prevent  incidents  that  can  adversely  impact  employees,  customers  and\ncommunities. Technological innovations that can detect and avoid many types of human factor incidents are designed to serve as an\nadditional  layer  of  protection  for  the  Company's  employees.  Continued  capital  investment  in  the  Company's  assets,  including  track,\nbridges, signals, equipment and detection technology also supports safety performance.\nIn third quarter 2022, velocity decreased by 11% and dwell increased by 12% versus prior year.

CSX uses current\ncash  balances  for  general  corporate  purposes,  which  may  include  capital  expenditures,  working  capital  requirements,  reduction  or\nrefinancing of outstanding indebtedness, redemptions and repurchases of CSX common stock, dividends to shareholders, acquisitions and\nother business opportunities, and contributions to the Company's qualified pension plan. See Note 7, Debt and Credit Agreements.\nThe Company has multiple sources of liquidity, including cash generated from operations and financing sources. The Company filed\na shelf registration statement with the SEC on February 16, 2022, which may be used to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion,\nsubject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements,\nthere can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all.\nDuring the nine months ended 2022, CSX issued a total of $2.0 billion of long-term debt.\nCSX Q3 2022 Form 10-Q p.38","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/e2dbc170-f9a6-417d-8833-aa1b7da9450e.pdf","pdf_numpages":94,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1462,"to":1489}}}}],["ef4222fa-228f-4cf5-b69f-b4c76fd9388e",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCSX has a $1.2 billion unsecured, revolving credit facility backed by a diverse syndicate of banks that expires in March 2024. At\nSeptember 30, 2022, the Company had no outstanding balances under this facility. The Company also has a commercial paper program,\nbacked  by  the  revolving  credit  facility,  under  which  the  Company  may  issue  unsecured  commercial  paper  notes  up  to  a  maximum\naggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion outstanding at any one time. At September 30, 2022, the Company had no outstanding debt\nunder the commercial paper program.\n    Planned capital investments for 2022 are expected to be approximately $2 billion. Of the 2022 investment, over 80% is expected to be\nused to sustain the core infrastructure and operating equipment. The remaining amounts will be used to promote profitable growth,\nincluding projects supporting service enhancements and productivity initiatives. CSX intends to fund capital investments primarily through\ncash generated from operations.\nMaterial Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Working Capital\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n    Total assets increased $1.7 billion from year end primarily due to a $941 million increase in net properties, a $319 million increase in\naccounts receivable, a $190 million increase in investments in affiliates and other companies and an $86 million increase in goodwill and\nother intangible assets. The increase in net property was primarily attributable to $581 million in fixed assets acquired as part of the Pan\nAm transaction as well as capital expenditures. Of the increase in accounts receivables, $124 million relates to the sale of property rights\nto the Commonwealth of Virginia and the remainder was commensurate with the increase in revenue. In addition, higher investments in\naffiliates and other companies includes the impact of the acquired interest in Pan Am Southern, LLC as well as increases in the values of\nseveral affiliates. See Note 11, Business Combinations, and Note 12, Goodwill and Other Intangibles, for more details.\nTotal liabilities increased $2.3 billion from year end primarily due to the issuance of $2.0 billion in long-term debt, a $249 million\nincrease in deferred taxes due to accelerated tax depreciation and the impact of the Pan Am acquisition, as well as an increase in\naccounts payable of $189 million. The increase in accounts payable was driven by higher debt interest payable and increased trade\npayables  mostly  due  to  the  timing  of  payments.  These  increases  were  partially  offset  by  debt  repayments  of  $178  million.  Total\nshareholders' equity decreased $617 million from year end primarily driven by share repurchases of $3.7 billion and dividends paid of $645\nmillion, partially offset by net earnings of $3.1 billion and common stock issued to acquire Pan Am of $422 million.\nWorking capital is considered a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital surplus of\n$1.8 billion as of September 30, 2022 and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. This increase of $162 million since year end was primarily\ndue to the $319 million increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by the $189 million increase in accounts payable. The Company's\nworking capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments and changes in cash and cash equivalent\nbalances as discussed above. The Company continues to maintain adequate liquidity to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations\nwhen they come due. CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and shelf\nregistration statement to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations.

For further details, refer to Note 11, Business Combinations.\nSale of Property Rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia\nOn March 26, 2021, the Company entered into a comprehensive agreement to sell certain property rights in three CSX-owned line\nsegments to the Commonwealth of Virginia (“Commonwealth”) over three phases for a total of $525 million. The timing and amount of\ngains recognized are based on the allocation of fair value to each conveyance, the timing of future conveyances and collectability. In April\n2021, upon closing of the first phase of the agreement, the Company collected $200 million in proceeds and recognized a $349 million\ngain. In fourth quarter 2021, the Company collected additional proceeds of $200 million, a portion of which was attributable to the first\nphase with the remainder attributable to the second phase. The second phase closed in January 2022, which resulted in a $20 million gain\nin first quarter 2022. During June 2022, the final $125 million of proceeds was approved by the Commonwealth, which resulted in a\n$122 million gain in second quarter 2022 related to property rights previously conveyed.

CSX Corporation has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes. At CSXT’s option, CSXT may\nredeem any or all of the notes, in whole or in part, at any time, at the redemption price including premium. In the case of loss or destruction\nof any item of equipment securing the notes, if CSXT does not substitute another item of equipment for the item suffering such loss or\ndestruction, CSXT will be required to redeem the notes in part at par. The guarantee of the notes will rank equally in right of payment with\nall existing and future senior obligations of CSX Corporation and will be effectively subordinated to all future secured indebtedness of CSX\nCorporation to the extent of the assets securing such indebtedness. The guarantee is subject to release in limited circumstances only upon\nthe occurrence of certain customary conditions.

Additionally, presentation of combined\nsummary financial information regarding subsidiary issuers and guarantors is not required because the assets, liabilities and results of\noperations of the combined issuers and guarantors of the notes are not materially different from the corresponding amounts presented in\nthe consolidated financial statements.\nLABOR AGREEMENTS\n    Approximately 16,700 of the Company’s employees are members of a labor union. The U.S. Class I railroads and rail labor unions were\nengaged in direct negotiations from January 2020 through June 2022. In accordance with the Railway Labor Act, a Presidential Emergency\nBoard issued its report and recommendations to settle the bargaining disputes on August 16, 2022. Tentative agreements based on these\nrecommendations were reached with all labor unions in September 2022. As of the date of this filing, six unions representing approximately\n17% of unionized rail employees have ratified those agreements. On October 10, 2022, one labor union voted against ratification of the\ntentative agreement. Ratification results for the remaining unions are scheduled to be announced through November 2022.\nCSX Q3 2022 Form 10-Q p.41","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/e2dbc170-f9a6-417d-8833-aa1b7da9450e.pdf","pdf_numpages":94,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1560,"to":1585}}}}],["f9656cce-a7ca-4211-91d2-6c7c1d39fffc",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires\nthat  management  make  estimates  in  reporting  the  amounts  of  certain  assets  and  liabilities,  the  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ\nfrom those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular\nbasis.  Consistent  with  the  prior  year,  significant  estimates  using  management  judgment  are  made  for  the  areas  below.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThere  have  been  no  material  changes  in  market  risk  from  the  information  provided  under  Part  II,  Item  7A  (Quantitative  and\nQualitative Disclosures about Market Risk) of CSX's most recent annual report on Form 10-K except as provided below.\nChanges in interest rates may impact the cost of future interest payments on long-term debt issued by the Company, and as a\nresult, represent interest rate risk to the Company. In an effort to manage this risk, CSX may use certain financial instruments such as\nfixed-to-floating interest rate swaps. The following information, together with information included in Note 7, Debt and Credit Agreements,\ndescribes the key aspects of such contracts and the related market risk to CSX.\nIn first quarter 2022, CSX entered into five separate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps classified as fair value hedges. The swaps\nare designed to hedge 10 years of interest rate risk associated with market fluctuations attributable to the Secured Overnight Financing\nRate on a cumulative $800 million of fixed rate outstanding notes which are due between 2036 and 2040. As of September 30, 2022, the\nfair value of these swaps was a $120 million liability, which is included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The\nassociated cumulative adjustment to the hedged notes is included in long-term debt. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value\nof the interest rate swaps offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt so no gain or loss has been\nrecognized due to hedge ineffectiveness. Differences on the fixed-to-floating legs of the derivatives are recognized in interest expense and\nwere not material in third quarter or nine months ended 2022. The swaps will expire in 2032. If settled early, the remaining liability or asset\nwill be amortized over the remaining life of the associated notes.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nAs of September 30, 2022, under the supervision and with the participation of CSX's Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief\nFinancial Officer (“CFO”), management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls\nand procedures. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that, as of September 30, 2022, the Company's disclosure\ncontrols and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level in timely alerting them to material information required to be\nincluded in CSX's periodic SEC reports. There were no changes in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the third\nquarter of 2022 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting.\nCSX Q3 2022 Form 10-Q p.45","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/e2dbc170-f9a6-417d-8833-aa1b7da9450e.pdf","pdf_numpages":94,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1679,"to":1706}}}}],["2972c1a0-f6ab-4858-a453-988d87c00a7a",{"pageContent":"Table of Contents\nCSX CORPORATION\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

The administrator may make a reasonable charge for the copies.\nPrudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries\nIn addition to creating certain rights for you, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the\nemployee benefit plan. The people who operate your plan, called “fiduciaries” of the plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the\ninterest of you and other plan participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your employer, or any other person, may fire you or\notherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a welfare benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.\nEnforce Your Rights\nIf your claim for a welfare benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain\ncopies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules.\nUnder ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of Plan documents or the\nlatest annual report from the Plan and do not receive them within thirty (30) days, you may file suit in a Federal court. In such a case, the\ncourt may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the\nmaterials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the administrator.\nIf you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or Federal court. In\naddition, if you disagree with the Plan’s decision or lack thereof concerning the qualified status of a medical child support order, you may\nfile suit in a Federal court.\nIf it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse the plan’s money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may\nseek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a Federal court. The court will decide who should pay court\ncosts and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may\norder you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds your claim is frivolous.\nAssistance with Your Questions\nIf you have any questions about your Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, \nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included \nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as \nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a \nreasonable basis for our opinion. \nCritical Audit Matter \nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the \nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and \nthat (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved \nour especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters \ndoes not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by \ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or \non the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n34","metadata":{"source":"/workspaces/b3-digital/docs/pdf_up_10k_02042022.pdf","pdf_numpages":74,"loc":{"lines":{"from":2164,"to":2204}}}}],["c06988ec-7ef8-4cc7-89e3-31c4b7e2d304",{"pageContent":"Capitalization of Properties — Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statements \nCritical Audit Matter Description \nThe Corporation’s operations are highly capital intensive and their large network of assets turns over on a \ncontinuous basis. Each year, the Corporation develops a capital program for both the replacement of \nassets and for the acquisition or construction of new assets. In determining whether costs should be \ncapitalized, the Corporation exercises significant judgment in determining whether expenditures meet the \napplicable minimum units of property criteria and extend the useful life, improve the safety of operations, \nor improve the operating efficiency of existing assets. The Corporation capitalizes all costs of capital \nprojects necessary to make assets ready for their intended use and because a portion of the \nCorporation’s assets are self-constructed, management also exercises significant judgment in \ndetermining the amount of material, labor, work equipment, and indirect costs that qualify for \ncapitalization. Properties, net were $54,871 million as of December 31, 2021 and, during 2021, the \nCorporation’s capital investments were $2.9 billion.  \nWe identified the capitalization of property as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgment \nexercised by management in determining whether costs meet the criteria for capitalization. This, in turn, \nrequired a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether the \ncriteria to capitalize costs were met and to evaluate sufficiency of audit evidence to support \nmanagement’s conclusions. \nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \nOur procedures related to capitalization of property included the following, among others: \n·We tested the effectiveness of controls over the Corporation’s determination of whether costs\nrelated to the Corporation’s capital program should be capitalized or expensed.\n·W\ne evaluated the Corporation’s capitalization policy in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America.\n·F\nor a selection of capital projects, we performed the following:\n− O\nbtained the Corporation’s evaluation of each project and determined whether the \namount of costs to be capitalized met the criteria for capitalization as outlined within the \nCorporation’s policy by unit of property.  \n− O\nbtained supporting documentation that the project met the applicable minimum units of \nproperty criteria and was approved, and evaluated whether the project extended the \nuseful life of an existing asset, improved the safety of operations, or improved the \noperating efficiency of existing assets.  \n·F\nor a selection of capitalized costs during the year, we performed the following:\n− E\nvaluated whether the individual cost selected met the criteria for capitalization. \n− E\nvaluated whether the selection was accurately recorded at the appropriate amount \nbased on the evidence obtained. \nO\nmaha, Nebraska   \nFebruary 4, 2022  \nW\ne have served as the Corporation's auditor since 1967.

Our \nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based \non our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be \nindependent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the \napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nW\ne conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that \nwe plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control \nover financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

A company’s internal \ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance \nof records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the \nassets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to \npermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, \nand that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with \nauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance \nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s \nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nB\necause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect \nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk \nthat controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of

accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Union Pacific Corporation and \nSubsidiary Companies (the \"Corporation\") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of \nincome, comprehensive income, changes in common shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in \nthe period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our \nopinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period \nended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United \nStates) (PCAOB), the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria \nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of \nthe Treadway Commission and our report dated February 10, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the \nCorporation's internal control over financial reporting.  \nBasis for Opinion \nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an \nopinion on the Corporation's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with \nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal \nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material \nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material \nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to \nthose risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the \nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by \nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits \nprovide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nCritical Audit Matter  \nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements \nthat was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or \ndisclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex \njudgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, \ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the \ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \nCapitalization of Properties — Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statements \nCritical Audit Matter Description \nThe Corporation’s operations are highly capital intensive and their large network of assets turns over on a continuous \nbasis.

The Corporation \ncapitalizes all costs of capital projects necessary to make assets ready for their intended use and because a portion of the \nCorporation’s assets are self-constructed, management also exercises significant judgment in determining the amount of \nmaterial, labor, work equipment, and indirect costs that qualify for capitalization. Properties, net were $56,038 million as \nof December 31, 2022 and, during 2022, the Corporation’s capital investments were $3.6 billion.  \nWe identified the capitalization of property as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgment exercised by \nmanagement in determining whether costs meet the criteria for capitalization. This, in turn, required a high degree of \nauditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether the criteria to capitalize costs were met and to \nevaluate sufficiency of audit evidence to support management’s conclusions. \nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit \nOur procedures related to capitalization of property included the following, among others:  \n· We tested the effectiveness of controls over the Corporation’s determination of whether costs related to the \nCorporation’s capital investments should be capitalized or expensed. \n \n· We evaluated the Corporation’s capitalization policy in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted \nin the United States of America. \n \n· For a selection of capital projects, we performed the following:  \n \n− Obtained the Corporation’s evaluation of each project and determined whether the amount of costs to \nbe capitalized met the criteria for capitalization as outlined within the Corporation’s policy by unit of \nproperty.  \n \n− Obtained supporting documentation that the project met the applicable minimum units of property \ncriteria and was approved, and evaluated whether the project extended the useful life of an existing \nasset, improved the safety of operations, or improved the operating efficiency of existing assets.  \n \n· For a selection of capitalized costs during the year, we performed the following: \n \n− Evaluated whether the individual cost selected met the criteria for capitalization. \n \n− Evaluated whether the selection was accurately recorded at the appropriate amount based on the \nevidence obtained. \n \n \n \nOmaha, Nebraska   \nFebruary 10, 2023   \n \nWe have served as the Corporation's auditor since

Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring \nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over \nfinancial reporting based on our audit.

Our audit included obtaining an \nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness \nexists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the \nassessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the \ncircumstances.

A company’s internal \ncontrol over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the \nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are \nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally \naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made \nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide \nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect \nmisstatements.
